Fox News star Sean Hannity bought an oceanfront townhome in Palm Beach for $14.9 million in an off-market deal, just a month after buying a mansion in nearby Manalapan for $23.5 million.
Records show Hannity bought the townhome at 10 Sloans Curve Drive from Clifford and Barbara Sobel. Hannity also owns the adjacent townhouse at 9 Sloans Curve Drive, which he bought for
$5.3 million
in 2021.


Clifford Sobel is a financier and former ambassador to the Netherlands and Brazil. The couple bought the townhouse for
$7.5 million
in 2022. The 4,600-square-foot home was built in 1981 on 0.2 acres, records show. It has two bedrooms, three bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and beach access, according to records and the listing.
Hannity has been investing heavily in South Florida residential real estate after announcing he was “done” with New York early last year. He sold his Long Island home for
$12.7 million
in June, and closed on a waterfront mansion in Manalapan for
$23.5 million
last month. Hannity won approval to expand his other Sloans Curve townhouse in 2022. Both the condos and his Manalapan mansion are a short drive from President Donald Trump’s
Mar-a-Lago Club
.
The Palm Beach market is in its busy season, and pricey sales are closing. Earlier this month, investor Anthony Beyer and his wife, Vanessa Beyer, sold their house for
$24 million
. Also this month, Goya heir Andrew Unanue sold a house on the island for
$27.5 million
. And financiers Richard and Cornelia Thornburgh sold their waterfront home on Everglades Island for
$25.4 million
.

Billy Joel rounded up another equestrian estate, this time buying in East Hampton.
The legendary singer spent $10.7 million to purchase 143 Town Lane in the Hamptons community, the New York Post
reported
. The sale quietly unfolded in December; the property hasn’t appeared on the market since 2019, according to
Zillow
.
Built in 2001, the estate spans more than five acres with 3,500 square feet of interior livable space, breaking the sale down to $3,057 per square foot. The property includes four bedrooms and five bathrooms.
The property has extensive equestrian facilities, including an eight-stall heated barn with a hayloft and tack room, a Grand Prix field and a sand ring. The grounds also have a lily pond and gunite pool, according to the Zillow listing.
Joel’s wife, Alexis Roderick, is an accomplished equestrian and the property adds to a common theme in the family’s other real estate holdings. In 2018, Joel purchased an equestrian estate in Wellington, Florida for $3.5 million, according to the
Daily Mail
.
Joel and his wife also wanted to build a 12-horse facility on their property in Centre Island, NBC New York
reported
, though neighbors’ concerns about the potential smell of horse manure complicated those plans. Joel listed the Long Island estate last year
for $49 million
.


In 2015, Joel purchased a 13,000-square-foot, eight bedroom mansion in Palm Beach for $22.1 million before putting the 1.6-acre property back on the market in 2018 for $21.9 million.
The Grammy winner also sold a vacant lot at 1930 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach in 2018 for
$7.5 million.
Joel also owns a summer home in another Hamptons locale, Sag Harbor.
.
Joel is weeks away from ending a historic residency at New York’s Madison Square Garden, where he’s set to perform for the 150th time in his life in July. This year, he released “Turn the Lights Back On,” his first single in 17 years.

Kris Jenner has stuck the for-sale sign up on her family’s famed Hidden Hills property that appeared on several seasons of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.”
Jenner has placed the home on the market for $13.5 million, enlisting Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California’s Tomer Fridman to sell the property.
Fridman has a long-standing relationship with the Kardashians and Jenners that spans more than a decade of working with various members of the family on the listing and purchasing of real estate in their expansive
portfolios
.
Among Fridman’s more recent deals with the family was the sale of
Khloé Kardashian’s former home
in Calabasas for $15.5 million in 2020.
The current listing at 25115 Eldorado Meadow Road was purchased by Jenner and ex-husband Bruce Jenner — now Caitlyn Jenner — in 2010 for $4 million, according to property records. It’s not clear how much the two may have spent on upgrades to the home.


The over 8,800-square-foot Mediterranean-style property features six beds and eight baths on an over 1.5-acre lot. It has an office space in addition to six en-suite bedrooms, according to marketing materials.
A major highlight of the home is its primary suite, which has a fireplace, a wet bar, a steam shower, a private gym and a balcony.
The amenities extend beyond the home, with the gated community offering residents tennis courts, pools, equestrian areas, hiking trails and a recreation center.
A double staircase anchoring the foyer is just one of several parts of the home television viewers are likely to recognize from the family’s reality TV show, which began airing on the E! network in 2007. The show enjoyed a 20-season run on the network, in addition to multiple spinoff series.
In 2022, the Kardashian-Jenner clan reemerged with a new spin on the family’s classic series tracking their lives. They made the jump over to streaming service Hulu with the launch of “The Kardashians.”

A beauty mogul found a buyer for her Greenwich Village townhouse just three weeks after it hit the market.
Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, snagged a signed contract for their home at 118 West 12th Street, last asking just under $19 million, according to the listing on Compass’ website.
The couple bought the four-story pad for nearly $18 million in November under an LLC called The Ruby Doggo 2023 Trust Agreement, six months before apparently trading it for a historic brownstone in Brooklyn Heights.
The duo last month signed a contract to purchase
1 Sidney Place
for $22 million, sources with knowledge of the sale told
The Real Deal
. If the home closes for that price, it would be one of the most expensive single-family sales in Brooklyn, second only to 8 Montague Terrace, which sold for $25.5 million in 2020.
Demand for homes in Brooklyn soared during and after the pandemic, with several neighborhoods in the borough securing their spot among the city’s most coveted luxury markets.
This includes Brooklyn Heights, which ranked as the 21st priciest neighborhood in the city last quarter with a median sale price of more than $1.2 million, according to a
Property Shark report
.
But prices in the Brooklyn neighborhood didn’t quite reach those in Greenwich Village last quarter. The neighborhood ranked 19th in the report with a median sale price of nearly $1.4 million.


The downtown Manhattan townhouse, built in 1899, spans 6,600 square feet and has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features 1,600 square feet of outdoor space, including a backyard and terrace.
The Greek Revival home traded for nearly $15 million just two years prior to Weiss and Gaybrick’s purchase, according to property records.
Clayton Orrigo, Stephen Ferrara and Eva Alt of Compass’ The Hudson Advisory Team had the listing. Orrigo declined to comment on the identity of the buyer.
The 30-agent Hudson Advisory Team crowned
TRD’s
2023 ranking
of the top resale brokers in the city with more than $316 million in sales across 75 closed sell-side transactions.
Douglas Elliman’s Sabrina Saltiel, who represented the buyer in the deal, declined to comment.
Weiss founded Glossier in 2014. The company
developed a cult following early on for products
like the Boy Brow eyebrow gel and reached a $2 billion valuation during her time as CEO. She stepped down from the role in 2022, the same year she and Gaybrick had their first child, and now serves as the executive chair.
Gaybrick is the president of product and business at the financial payment platform Stripe. The firm was recently valued at
$65 billion
, making it one of the highest-valued startups in the country along with SpaceX and OpenAI.

David and Victoria Beckham paid $72.3 million for a waterfront spec mansion in Miami Beach, setting a record for the city’s North Bay Road.
Retired soccer champion David Beckham, co-owner of the Major League Soccer team Inter Miami, and Victoria, a fashion designer, singer and businesswoman,
acquired
the 14,270-square-foot, nine-bedroom estate at 4736 North Bay Road, sources previously told
The Real Deal
.
The sale closed on Monday, according to the Multiple Listing Service. Property records show developer Niklas de la Motte sold the home. It was on the market with Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty for $80 million.
Luxury homebuilder Bart Reines constructed the new home, which has nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa, home theater, a pool and an outdoor kitchen and lounge. The 0.6-acre property includes 124 feet of water frontage. Choeff Levy Fischman designed the house with Antrobus Design Collection.
Motte paid $10 million for the North Bay Road property in 2018, which then included an older home. The new home has been on the market since November 2022.


The Beckhams own a full-floor condo at the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum tower in downtown Miami. They paid about
$19.8 million
for the 10,000-square-foot unit in 2020. It’s not currently on the market.
David Beckham had been working on bringing MLS soccer to Miami for years before the team’s inaugural season in 2020. The team’s star roster includes soccer greats Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets.
Beckham and his Inter Miami partners, led by MasTec Chairman Jorge Mas, plan to develop a major
mixed-use soccer complex
on the former Melreese golf course site near Miami International Airport.
Other property owners on North Bay Road include billionaire media mogul Barry Diller, who is married to fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg; Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber; former Softbank Group International CEO Marcelo Claure; and billionaire developer-hotelier
Barry Sternlicht
.
Diller recently paid a
record $45 million
for the waterfront 1.5-acre lot at 5930 North Bay Road.

A Victorian row house in San Francisco that starred in “Full House” has hit the market for $6.5 million.
The three-story house used to showcase the Tanner family residence in the ‘90s sitcom is up for grabs at 1709 Broderick Street, in Lower Pacific Heights,
Architectural Digest reported
. The seller was not disclosed.
The 3,700-square-foot home, built by architect Charles Lewis Hinkel, is distinctly San Franciscan, with intricate moldings, bay windows and a brick stoop. The listing claims it was built both in 1883 and in 1900.
The beige house with white trim and a charcoal door has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It last traded in 2020 for $5.35 million.
It has a gourmet kitchen complete with custom cabinets, Calacatta Oro countertops and Viking appliances, a backyard English garden and a two-car garage with a small fitness room.
A buyer would have the option of securing handprints in concrete of the “Full House” cast, including Bob Saget and John Stamos.


The house was renovated in 2019 by Richard Landry of Landry Design Group, based in Los Angeles. In this case, life imitated art — with the home’s new interior mirroring the TV show set at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank.
“The fact that the front is so iconic due to eight years of being flashed on TV screens around the world made it especially fun to be a part of the project,” William Mungall, an architect with Landry Design Group, told Architectural Digest.
“We were inspired by the show for the interior as well, opening up the living space to feature the staircase for dramatic entrances and combining several small rooms into a large kitchen featuring a walk-around island similar to the show.”
The 0.07-acre property is
listed
by Rachel Swann of The Swann Group, affiliated with the San Francisco Pacific Heights office of Coldwell Banker Realty in Northern California.
A San Francisco duplex featured on an episode of the A&amp;E series “Hoarders” received 12 offers and sold early this year for
$1.2 million — $500,000 over the asking price
, according to
The Real Deal.

An heiress to the Sara Lee frozen dessert fortune just grabbed a sweet New York residence.
A trust for Sara Lee Schupf bought a
co-op unit
at 620 Park Avenue for $10.75 million,
according to city records
.
Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s International Realty represented the seller, Nina S. Brody.
The 10-room unit, which takes up an entire floor of the building, has up to four bedrooms, hardwood floors, high ceilings, climate control and gallery-quality lighting, heated floors in bathrooms and a Sonos sound system.
The unit has a private elevator which leads to a square gallery, entertainment rooms, a living room (with a fireplace), dining room and wood-paneled library.


There’s also a chef’s eat-in kitchen, service pantry, laundry room, and a staff room with a full bath. The primary bedroom has views of Park Avenue as well as a fireplace, dressing room and bath.  There is one additional bedroom with an ensuite bath..
Schupf has used her family fortune to promote women’s interest in STEM careers. She is a trustee of the New York Hall of Science, a trustee of the Eugene Lang College at The New School, and a trustee emerita of Skidmore College, according to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences website
.
Her trust is buying the co-op; if the trust also funds her philanthropy, it could be a business asset rather than a primary residence.
She also has said that she loves to cook but, unlike how her family amassed its fortune, she does not bake, according to CKBK.com.
“At one point, I was thinking about being a kitchen design space planner and I enjoy designing kitchens that work,” she says on the site. “I am a cookbook collector, lover of well-designed and practical kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and basically anything to do with food. … Today my main focus is supporting STEM education, women scientists, and programs that encourage young women to engage in STEM. People do not think of cooking being a science, but it is. So let’s get cookin!!”

A Tribeca condo previously owned by actor Mike Myers has once again traded hands.
Unit 5A at Metro Lofts’ 443 Greenwich Street sold in an off-market deal for $20.7 million, or $4,880 per square foot, according to public records and a previous Streeteasy listing. The apartment traded for $6 million more than the last purchase price.
The property’s mortgage holder is the same entity as the buyer, Triana 443 LLC. The address listed is another condo in the building, Unit 2J, which John Zito, a partner and executive at asset management firm Apollo, bought for $8.6 million in 2021.
Myers purchased the 4,200-square-foot pad for just under $15 million in 2016, but the actor — known for starring in the spy comedy series Austin Powers — put it
back on the market
just a week later. It sold to an unknown buyer for $14 million in 2017.
The corner condo has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.


The 53-unit condo conversion with an underground garage is known for being “paparazzi-proof.” Amenities include an indoor pool, fitness center, sauna and landscaped roof deck.
With a reputation for privacy, the building has attracted a
star-studded list of buyers
, including Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton and Harry Styles.


It’s also home to a number of pricey deals. Bill and Melinda Gates’ daughter paid
$51 million
for a six-bedroom penthouse, which was among the 10 most expensive sales in the city last year.
Though it has fetched lofty prices, some owners claim the building is
riddled with defects
and code violations, including some they considered “life-threatening,” according to a lawsuit filed by the condo board.
In the lawsuit, which seeks $376 million in damages, the board alleges there were leaks in the penthouses, improperly laid bricks and flooding in the courtyard, which lacked an effective drainage system.

Former Miami Heat player Goran Dragić, a.k.a. “the Dragon,” sold his waterfront Miami home in Bay Point.
Dragić and his now ex-wife, Maja, sold their seven-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom house at 586 Sabal Palm Road for $13.4 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service and property records.
Ross Romash, a developer, pro poker player and powerboat racer, bought the property, according to sources.
Goran Dragić, a National Basketball Association All-Star, retired from the league at the end of 2023. He played for the
Miami Heat
between 2015 and 2021, at which point he was traded to the Toronto Raptors. The Dragićs finalized their divorce in late 2023, court records show.
They paid $7 million for the nearly 6,000-square-foot house in 2016, records show. It sits on a half-acre lot in the gated Bay Point community. The home, built in 2003, hit the market in 2023 for $19.9 million.


It was most recently asking $14.9 million with Compass agent Julianna Castro. Castro also represented the buyer, according to the MLS.
Castro, who declined to comment on the buyer and sellers’ identities, said interest in the house picked up after the election. She said the buyer is an end-user who plans to live in the property.
Romash
sold a waterfront home
in Miami’s Belle Meade in 2021 for $13.3 million.
A recent sale in Bay Point set a record for the neighborhood. In January, Fatos Rosenberg sold the 1.7-acre property at 4445 Sabal Palm Road for

Ben Affleck is moving to an equestrian estate in Brentwood as rumors heat up that he and Jennifer Lopez are headed for a split.
Affleck closed on the five-bed, six-bath home in the Sullivan Canyon neighborhood for $20.5 million, TMZ reported.
The seller was David Calvert-Jones, media titan Rupert Murdoch’s nephew, according to property records. Calvert-Jones first placed the home at 13233 Riviera Ranch Road on the market in October with an asking price of $21.5 million, Zillow data shows.
The businessman and producer, along with his wife Karina Calvert-Jones, were longtime owners of the property after buying it in 2010 for $4.4 million, according to property records.
The Agency’s Blair Chang had the listing, while The Agency’s Santiago Arana represented Affleck.


The gated, equestrian home was built in 1941 and designed by California architect Cliff May, whose name is synonymous with the state’s ranch-style homes. Architect Steve Giannetti went on to add his touch in later renovation work to the property.
It features both primary and guest homes, in addition to stables, a walking ring and tack room for horse owners. It’s also in close proximity to the Brentwood Country Mart and the Riviera and Brentwood country clubs.
The Brentwood pad is a more modest footprint compared with the 12-bed, 24-bath estate he and Lopez listed earlier this month. The Beverly Crest mansion hit the market with a $68 million ask.  Whomever snaps up the property takes on a newly renovated home in the gated community of Wallingford Estates. The couple paid $60.9 million for the 38,000-square-foot home at 2571 Wallingford Drive last May.

The sale of Ilya Kovalchuk’s incomplete New Jersey mansion has bedeviled the former NHL star for years, but those days could soon be over.
The Russian-born hockey player and his wife, singer Nicole Andrazajtis Kovalchuk, are in contract to sell their home at 10 Frick Drive in Alpine, the New York Post
reported
. The deal has yet to close, but sources told the outlet it’s close to the last asking price of $10.9 million.
The couple listed the 22,000-square-foot property in 2019 for nearly $18 million, but buyers quickly vanquished their hopes of a quick and pricey sale to the penalty box. The ask was lowered to $16 million after a year, then
$15 million last year
before ultimately coming down to the latest ask.
The identity of the buyer was not reported.
The couple purchased the two-acre parcel in 2010 for $4.5 million, setting out to build a dream luxury property after Kovalchuk inked a 15-year, $100 million pact to remain a member of the New Jersey Devils for the balance of his career. Things fell apart on the ice, however, and Kovalchuk returned to Russia three years later, leaving a shell of a home behind.
The property, which will take the incoming owner an additional $6 million to complete, includes eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, along with several powder rooms and a “banquet-size” dining room.


The home also has a chef’s kitchen, prep kitchen, walk-in pantry and wine storage. Additional features include a lounge, theater, bar and guest suite.
Dennis McCormack of Prominent Properties Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.
Kovalchuk, a three-time NHL All-Star, played for the Atlanta Thrashers, Devils, Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens and Washington Capitals. He won an Olympic gold medal in 2018 while representing the unofficial Russian team, then served as general manager for the Russian Olympic Committee’s men’s ice hockey team that competed in Beijing four years later.
The Kovalchuk clan also put a Miami Beach luxury condo on the market for $14.5 million. That listing comes only a year after they purchased the pad on South Florida’s exclusive Fisher Island
for $8.5 million
, or $2,200 per square foot.

reported
. The property is 14,000 square feet, breaking down the listing price to approximately $1,564 per square foot.
The couple purchased the 7-acre estate for around $10 million in 2006. Moore, best known for starring on “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” died in 2017. Levine decided to sell as part of the process of moving on after his wife’s death.
The Georgian-style house was likely built late in the 19th century, but its exact origin is unknown. After the couple bought the home, they tore down virtually everything except the front facade, a three-year project that nearly doubled the size of the property and cost close to the asking price of the five-bedroom home.
The entryway has a curving staircase and harlequin-patterned floors, along with a wall of windows to look out on the garden and a skylight. The primary suite is in its own wing, containing dual dressing rooms, including a closet with 100 linear feet of hanging space.


The home also has a spa with a massage room, Jazucci and sauna, a gym with a ballet barre, a solarium (a personal favorite spot of Moore’s, according to her husband), a billiards room and an outdoor pool.
Sotheby’s International Realty’s Joseph Barbieri has the
listing
. Levine said a portion of proceeds from the sale will go towards the Mary Tyler Moore Vision Initiative, which aims to preserve and restore vision for those with diabetes; Moore was diagnosed with diabetes in 1969 and was reportedly losing her vision due to the disease towards the end of her life.
The housing market in Greenwich has been constrained by low inventory, but notched some peak deals. A
$139 million deal
for 50-acre Copper Beech Farm in August marked the largest sale in state history. Just last week, a home on a 27-acre estate in the town
sold for $30 million
. There have been eight $30 million sales in the town’s history, two coming in recent weeks alone.

Joe Jonas received an extra birthday gift this year with the sale of his and wife Sophie Turner’s waterfront Miami mansion.
The Jonas Brothers singer-guitarist-pianist, who turned 34 on Tuesday, and Turner, of “Game of Thrones” fame, sold the home at 4400 Island Road for $15 million on Tuesday, according to the Multiple Listing Service.
Real estate investor Fazeel Khan purchased the property, according to the
Wall Street Journal
.
The celebrity couple
entered into a contract
to sell the 10,400-square-foot mansion, with six bedrooms and eight and a half bathrooms, in April. It most recently was asking $15.5 million with Compass agent Carl Gambino. Gambino did not respond to a request for comment. David Pullman of One Sotheby’s International Realty represented Khan.
The home is in Miami’s
Bay Point
neighborhood, which has seen major gains in sale prices over the past three years. Turner and Jonas
paid $11 million
for the mansion in 2021; they sold it this week for a 36 percent gain.
The renovated house, built in 1980, sits on a 0.4-acre lot with a koi pond, wine cellar, fireplace and pool. Its previous owners include Cuban-American musician Willy Chirino.


Jonas and his brothers Nick and Kevin filmed their music video for “Cool” in Miami in 2019, and Jonas has been spotted around town over the years.
Bay Point is north of downtown Miami and the Miami Design District.
In February, the CEO of Adonel Concrete sold his waterfront mansion at 4505 Sabal Palm Road
for $38.5 million
, marking a new record for Bay Point. That was more than double the previous record, which was the $18 million sale of the waterfront home at 580 Sabal Palm Road.
More recently, Chilean casino mogul Claudio Fischer sold the waterfront teardown at 770 Lake Road in Bay Point
for $9 million
. Goldwing Financial LLC, a Florida corporation managed by Carlos Safie, purchased the property. Safie is chairman and CEO of Executive National Bank, a regional bank headquartered in Miami.

Terry McGuirk, chairman of the Atlanta Braves, bought a penthouse in Palm Beach for $5.9 million.
Records show McGuirk and his wife, Nancy McGuirk, bought penthouse B at Four Hundred South Ocean at 400 South Ocean Boulevard from Kevin Byrne and William Ameringer. The deal marked the
priciest condo sale
in Palm Beach County last week.
Christian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing, and Crista Ryan with Tina Fanjul Associates brought the buyer.
Terry McGuirk is the longtime chairman and CEO of Braves Holdings, the parent company of the Atlanta Braves and Braves Development Company. His involvement with the team dates back to Ted Turner’s 1976 purchase of the team. McGuirk was a longtime executive with Turner’s Turner Broadcasting, and stayed on as chairman of the Braves when Turner sold the team to billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media in 2007, according to published reports. In November, Malone bolstered McGuirk’s power within the team, granting him new voting rights as well as right of first refusal on potential future team stock sales by Malone, according to the

A year after going into contract to buy a trophy estate in Indian Creek Village, French DJ and music producer David Guetta sold his Setai Miami Beach condo for $16 million.
Guetta sold unit 3709 in the tower at 101 20th Street to an undisclosed buyer. The sale closed last week, and the deed has yet to be recorded.
Michael Wiesenfeld of the Corcoran Group represented the seller, and Eloy Carmenate, Mick Duchon and Joshua Winarick, also of Corcoran, brought the buyer. At $6,337 per square foot, the deal sets a price per square foot record for Miami Beach, according to a Corcoran spokesperson.


Guetta is a French DJ known for producing some of the most popular songs of the 2000s and 2010s. His discography includes “Where Them Girls At,”
featuring Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj; “Without You,” featuring Usher; and “Titanium,” featuring Sia. He’s also won two Grammy Awards.
Guetta bought the Setai condo from developer
Richard LeFrak
in 2018 for
$9.5 million
. The 2,500-square-foot unit has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, property records show. The 40-story oceanfront condo-hotel was built in 2005, and has more than 160 units, according to published reports. The billionaire Nakash family, which founded Jordache Jeans and has an estimated $1.9 billion net worth according to Forbes, bought the hotel portion for
$90 million
in 2014.
For his part, Guetta is considerably upsizing from the Setai unit. Last year, he went into contract to buy a 1.2-acre spec estate with 118 feet of waterfront in Indian Creek Village. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners have the 16,000-square-foot mansion listed for
$69 million
, and the sale is still pending.
Guetta will have plenty of celebrity neighbors on the private island. Indian Creek has been a hub of
trophy deals
attached to big names in recent years. Since October, billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has snapped up three homes on the island in three separate deals totaling
$234 million
. Dutch magnetics heir Geert-Jan Bakker sold his waterfront estate to an undisclosed buyer for
$64.5 million
in May. In July, Tom Brady scored
a $35 million construction loan
for the mansion he’s building on the island. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner bought a home on the island for
$24 million
in 2021.

NBA All-Star Victor Oladipo sold his Miami Beach home, two months after he was traded to the Oklahoma Thunder.
Records show Oladipo sold the house at 65 South Hibiscus Drive for $9 million, two years after dropping a then-record
$7.8 million
on the non-waterfront home.
Liz Hogan of Compass had the listing, and Matthew Krac of Americore International Realty brought the buyer. The deed has yet to be recorded, and the buyer is unknown.
Oladipo was a newly minted Miami Heat player in 2021 when he bought the 6,500-square-foot home. Built in 2020, the house includes seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms and one half-bathroom, records show. It spans 0.3-acres, a size that Hogan said is a rarity for Hibiscus Island. The home also has two master bedrooms, a separate guest house, and a pool, Hogan said.
Oladipo’s 2021 purchase of the house was a price record for non-waterfront homes in Miami Beach at the time, one that was quickly shattered as pandemic demand caused a price surge in the area. The current price record for non-waterfront Miami Beach homes was set in 2022, when a Sunset Islands home sold for
$12.5 million.


Hogan said the latest sale sets a price record for non-waterfront homes on Hibiscus Island. Oladipo listed the house for $10 million in June, Redfin shows.
The two-time NBA All-Star has suffered repeated injury over the course of his 10-year career in the league. The Heat traded him to the Thunder in July, although there is some speculation he could be traded again, Hogan said. In June, Oladipo filed suit against his longtime manager, James Henderson, alleging he stole $1.3 million from Oladipo and invested it in a strip club and a condo, according to the
Bleacher Report.
While his basketball future is unknown, Oladipo wants to maintain a “home base” in the Miami area, and wants a larger yard for his daughter, Hogan confirmed. They have been looking at homes in Weston, Davie, Southwest Ranches, and
Pinecrest
, a popular inland hub for NBA players, Hogan confirmed.
Heat player Tyler Herro bought a Pinecrest mansion for
$10.5 million
in December.
Retired NBA player Jason Richardson bought a home just south of Olympia Heights for
$6.3 million
earlier this month. Last year, Miami Heat player Jimmy Butler bought a South Miami home for
$7.4 million
in February of last year.

Danish tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki and her husband, former NBA player David Lee, are under contract to sell their Fisher Island penthouse that is asking $42.5 million.
The pending deal is at the top of last week’s Eklund-Gomes luxe signed contracts report, which tracks properties priced at $4 million and above.
Wozniacki and Lee will likely make a big profit. A company managed by the couple paid $18.7 million for the unit in 2021.
Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer represented the sellers of the 7,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom condo at 7001 Fisher Island Drive. It hit the market in January. Goldentayer declined to comment.
Last week, buyers signed contracts for 15 luxury homes and condos in Miami-Dade County asking a combined $213.6 million, according to the report, authored by the Douglas Elliman mega team. That’s four fewer than
the week prior,
but a $69 million weekly increase in dollar volume.


Nine of the contracts signed last week were for single-family homes, and six were for condos.
The most expensive single-family home to enter into contract is the house at 2700 Sunset Drive in Miami Beach. Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd and his wife Laurie hired spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser to build the roughly 9,000-square-foot mansion on the property, which is asking nearly $40 million. The couple paid
$11.2 million for the half-acre lot
in 2021.
The single-family homes priced at $4 million and up that went into contract last week spent 163 days on the market on average before securing buyers. The asking dollar volume for those homes totaled $132.6 million.
The luxury condos that entered into contracts were on the market for an average of 198 days, and averaged about $2,800 per square foot. The total dollar asking volume for the condos was $81 million. Eklund-Gomes’ report mimics the Olshan report released weekly covering Manhattan luxury contracts. In New York, buyers signed contracts for
24 homes last week,
according to the latest Olshan report. Their combined asking price was $251 million, and the typical home spent 747 days on the market.

Ivan Lendl, one of the greatest tennis players of all time, has added another distinction to his record: priciest home sale in the history of Litchfield County.
The legendary athlete sold his 445-acre estate at 400 5 ½ Mile Road in Cornwall, Connecticut, for $12 million, Mansion Global
reported
. Last week’s deal narrowly surpassed an $11.5 million deal to become the most expensive in county history.
While the sale was a victory for Lendl, who won
eight major titles
from 1984 to 1990, it took quite a bit longer than a fortnight. The property had been on and off the market since he listed it eight years ago for $19.8 million. Lendl lowered the price
to $16.4 million
in March 2021 and most recently to $15 million.
The former world No. 1 purchased the enormous estate in the 1980s for $4.2 million.


The vast plot of land has an 18,000-square-foot mansion roughly two hours from New York City and Boston. The home has 10 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, a gym, a locker room, an outdoor granite pool, a fishing pond, a barn and, of course, a tennis court.
Architect Allan Greenberg designed the three-story home for Lendl and his wife, Samantha. Before then, the couple lived in a seven-bedroom mansion in Greenwich, which they sold in 2020 for $5.2 million. The couple had been using the Cornwall estate as a summer-fall house, going back and forth from Florida.
The buyer of Lendl’s massive estate could not immediately be discerned. Elyse Harney Real Estate’s Elyse Harney Morris and Bill Melnick had the
listing
. William Raveis’ Kiara Rusconi represented the buyer.
Lendl earned more than $21 million in prize money during his playing career, winning the Australian Open twice, the French Open three times and the U.S. Open from 1985 to 1987. The Czech native was also a two-time Wimbledon finalist. In retirement, Lendl has coached the likes of tennis superstars Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.

The owners of Cher’s former home
believe
they can cash in on the superstar’s former digs.
Canadian financier James Eaton and his wife, Cecily, have listed the Miami Beach mansion at 64 La Gorce Circle for $42.5 million, the Wall Street Journal
reported
. The couple purchased the home
only three years ago
for $17 million.
The “Goddess of Pop” hasn’t lived there since 1996. Her occupancy of the mansion was relatively brief, buying it in 1993 for $1.5 million as her abode away from the public eye before selling it three years later for $4.4 million, when it was purchased by Calvin Klein co-founder Barry Schwartz.
It’s not clear why the Eatons are eager to sell. It’s one of only 30 waterfront homes on guard-gated La Gorce Island and a property the couple spent two years gut-renovating.
Built in 1953, the estate covers three-quarters of an acre and has 150 feet of frontage on Biscayne Bay. The main home is more than 12,000 square feet large with six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and an interior courtyard crafted into the design.


The exterior space includes a 50-foot long pool, a pool house, a hot tub, a cold plunge and an outdoor shower.
Douglas Elliman’s Dina Goldentayer has the listing, which breaks down to roughly $3,415 per square foot.
Cher, a 77-year-old multihyphenate, is best known for songs such as “Believe” and “If I Could Turn Back Time,” movies like “Moonstruck” and being half of the famous duo known as Sonny &amp; Cher. While her work in entertainment has slowed, she recently launched a line of gelato.
She’s also working hard on selling real estate that still belongs to her. Last year, Cher listed a Malibu home she’s owned since prior to her La Gorce Island stay for
$85 million
. This year, she knocked down the price on the 13,000-square-foot mansion
to $75 million
; she bought the property in 1989 for $3 million before building the home on the land.

For the Keyes Company, there’s no “Good Feeling” about a former client banking
$10 million
from the sale of a Miami Gardens retail plaza to rapper Flo Rida and his business manager, Lee “Freezy” Prince.
In a lawsuit filed last week in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, Keyes is alleging the seller, North Miami-based G.I.A. Investments, owes the brokerage $300,000. That represents the 3 percent commission allegedly earned from last month’s deal headlined by the Miami-based hip-hop artist, whose real name is Tramar Dillard.
Keyes
declined comment through a spokesman. Peter Izaak, manager of G.I.A. Investments, said the allegations in Keyes’ lawsuit are false. “It’s in our lawyers’ hands,” Izaak said via text message. “And the listing ended many months before any discussion of a sale.”
The deal closed on July 14. Strong Arm Management, an entity managed by Prince and Flo Rida, whose hit songs include “Low” and “Good Feeling,” acquired Cloverleaf Shopping Plaza, a 27,800-square-foot strip mall at 18130, 18138, 18164 and 18230 Northwest Second Avenue, as well as 230 Northwest 183rd Street.


In October of last year, G.I.A entered into a commercial listing agreement with Keyes to market Cloverleaf Shopping Plaza for sale, the lawsuit states. A copy of the agreement is attached to the lawsuit. Keyes subsequently advertised and promoted the property on multiple marketing services and using multiple methods to attract buyers, the lawsuit alleges.
In a July certified letter mailed to Izaak, Keyes attorney David Israel claims that the brokerage is entitled to its commission payment “for procuring a prospective buyer for the subject property, whether directly or not.”
G.I.A. “failed and refused” to pay
Keyes
despite “previous friendly efforts” to obtain the commission,” Israel wrote. “Instead, you have attempted to argue that the listing agreement expired in 2021, which is clearly not true,” he added. “[Keyes] will not continue to entertain your misstatements and will only accept commissions which are due and owing to [Keyes] without further delay.”
A family-run company, Keyes is one of the oldest and largest independent brokerages in Florida. Keyes is led by CEO Mike Pappas and his daughter, company president
Christina Pappas

Developer Alex Sapir and his estranged wife, Yanina, sold one of the family’s properties on the Venetian Islands to Shark Tank investor Rohan Oza,
The Real Deal
has learned.
The Sapirs, who are in the midst of a contentious divorce, sold the waterfront home at 206 West San Marino Drive to an entity tied to Oza for $9.8 million, sources told
TRD
. Oza owns the home next door.
Oza, a recurring guest investor on the reality TV show Shark Tank, was a former chief marketing officer for Glaceau, the parent company of Smartwater and Vitaminwater, which sold to Coca-Cola for $4.2 billion in 2007, according to published reports. He paid
$13.5 million
for the property adjacent to the Sapirs in December.
Evan Weiss of 305 Degrees Realty represented Oza in the two deals. He did not respond to a request for comment. Attorney Michael Gallinar with Adams Gallinar also represented Oza.
The home at 206 West San Marino Drive was marketed as a teardown. The 4,300-square-foot house sits on a 0.2-acre lot and was built in 1955. A trust in Yanina Sapir’s name paid just over $11 million for the property in December 2021.


Oza likely plans to knock down both of his homes and build a larger estate. The two lots total 0.6 acres.
Alex Sapir
, who is dating actress and TV host Leila Ben Khalifa, developed the boutique luxury condo Arte in Surfside. Sapir heads the Sapir Organization and Sapir Corp., both based in New York. He is expected to next work on a major mixed-use development near Edgewater and the Arts &amp; Entertainment District in Miami.
A filing in the Sapirs’ divorce states that a marital property was under contract as of mid-January, and was set to close a few weeks from then. But it did not name the property. The couple’s estate is estimated to be valued at more than $100 million, filings show. A trial on the divorce is set for later this year.
The Sapirs also own the waterfront mansion at 126 West San Marino Drive, on the opposite side of 206 West San Marino. Together, the two homes hit the market
for $54 million
with Luxe Living Realty owner/broker Dora Puig after Yanina filed for divorce in 2022. On its own, the house at 206 West San Marino Drive that just sold was previously asking $12.9 million.
Nearby on Di Lido Island, progressive heir Daniel Lewis recently sold his waterfront spec home
for $19.5 million
, adding to a string of pricey deals on the Venetian Islands.

Content:
The Brentwood estate owned by Jim Carrey is on to its third price cut since hitting the market last February.
The latest haircut to $21.9 million came last week,
Fox Business reported
. That’s about a 24 percent decline from the property’s original listing price of $28.9 million in February 2023.
The price was reduced to $26.5 million a couple months after and was cut again to $23.95 million in October.
Carrey originally bought the house in 1994, paying $3.8 million for the five-bedroom, nine-bathroom property, according to public records. That was the same year Carrey starred as Stanley Ipkiss in “The Mask” and Lloyd Christmas in “Dumb &amp; Dumber,” propelling the actor’s career.
The now-retired Carrey spends his time painting and sculpting.
The nearly 11,000-square-foot, ranch-style home sits on 2 acres at 615 North Tigertail Road. It was built in 1951.


Set behind more than 280 feet of hedges, the home includes an Art Deco-style theater, tennis court, waterfall pool, gazebo, platform for yoga and meditation and a guest house.
Janelle Friedman of Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.
The price cut comes amid activity in other parts of Brentwood.
Last week, a spec mansion at
1741 Correa Way
in Brentwood’s Mandeville Canyon sold for $23.5 million to a tech CEO after several price reductions. The seller of the more than 13,000-square-foot eco-conscious property was Los Angeles residential developer Wylan/James Development, which originally listed the home for $29.5 million in July.
Elsewhere in Mandeville Canyon, rapper Kendrick Lamar reportedly paid more than $40 million for the 16,200-square-foot home at
1707 Westridge Road
. The off-market deal, should it close, would be one of Los Angeles’ priciest so far this year.

Famed Enron short seller Jim Chanos has traditionally relied on the markets to make his dough — except when it comes to his latest real estate deal.
After several years of listing and delisting his Upper East Side penthouse triplex, Chanos pulled the trigger on a $19 million sale in an off-market deal, according to public records.
The hedge funder bought the 7,300-square-foot condo at 3 East 75th in 2008 for
$20 million
.
Chanos sought $34 million for the home back in 2019 when he first listed it with Douglas Elliman, and since then has rotated through a number of brokers and price points.
After taking it off the market in 2020, Chanos listed his home again in 2022, this time with Compass, for $23.5 million to no avail.
In 2023, the financier relisted the pad with Corcoran for the same price, before eventually cutting the price to $19.75 million. He finally took it off the market in November of last year.
Casa Blanca’s Hannah Bomze brought the anonymous buyer.


The modern, Thad Hayes-designed apartment sits atop a limestone mansion designed by C.P.H Gilbert in 1904. The 50-foot-wide mansion contains seven condo units. The penthouse has three beds and three full baths, as well as 2,800 square feet of outdoor space.
The top floor has a screening room and game room; the second level features a terrace that looks out onto Central Park, while the lowest floor has the primary bedroom with south-facing windows and another terrace. The middle floor contains an open-concept great room, eat-in kitchen and access to the terrace.
In the most recent StreetEasy listing, the home was also listed to rent for $75,000 per month.
Last May, Chanos also sold his
South Beach condo for $17.8 million
after buying it for $3.1 million in 2003.
The selloffs come after Chanos announced in 2023 that he was winding down his famed hedge fund, which he ran for nearly four decades. The fund saw its AUM shrink to less than $200 million from the $6 billion it managed in 2008, according to the
Wall Street Journal
.
Chanos’ claim to fame was pointing to irregularities in gas-pipeline company Enron’s public filings in 2001. That same year, the hyped energy firm imploded, filing for bankruptcy in one of the most notorious examples of corporate fraud in history.
The short seller also bet correctly on the financial crisis of 2008-09, but in recent years struggled to turn profits on his short positions against electric car maker Tesla while the market for bear trading has dried up.

One of the East Side’s vaunted co-ops has added a new resident.
Unit 12 at 960 Fifth Avenue traded hands for $53.5 million on Tuesday, according to public records. The sale for the prewar unit, which
hit the market in May 2023 for $70 million
, also included two staff rooms on the third floor of the property that also uses the address 3 East 77th Street.
.
The apartment has eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms, five wood-burning fireplaces and 11- to 13-foot ceilings. The 10 windows in the 12th-floor home face Fifth Avenue with views of Central Park.
The buyer is hidden in a trust, part of an
increasingly accepted convention
of buyer anonymity from the notoriously nosy properties.
The seller is the estate of former oil heiress Anne Hendricks Bass, who died in 2020.
The Rosario Candela-designed building comes with a private restaurant, in-house chef, rooftop fitness center and rooftop terrace.


The original listing price would have put the apartment in the rarified $70 million bucket of co-op sales.
One of the penthouse units at the Lenox Hill building broke the record for the most expensive co-op ever sold when it went for
$70 million to Nassef Sawiris
, Egypt’s richest man, in 2014. That record stood for just three months before a duplex at
740 Park Avenue sold for $71.3 million
to billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander.
As it stands, the sale of Unit 12 is the most expensive co-op sale so far this (barely two-week-old) year. The 30 percent discount from listing to closed price is emblematic of the state of the co-op market: In the fourth quarter last year, co-op median sales prices fell almost 8 percent year-over-year, according to data from Miller Samuel.
The 12-story building has housed a number of residents from notable families, including more recent additions of the
heir to the Estée Lauder fortune
and a
member of the wealthy Colombian family
that controls brewing giant SABMiller.
Compass’ Alexa Lambert had the listing.
Last year, Lambert moved another co-op in a celebrated building just a few doors down, selling Barbara Walters’ 11-room apartment at 944 Fifth Avenue for
$15 million
.
The buyer was an entity tied to former Disney president Michael Ovitz and his partner, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon.

UPDATED MAY 9 at 1:30 p.m.:
A Los Angeles lawsuit entangles a television producer, a city with deep pockets and a Brentwood home once owned by Marilyn Monroe, whose life ended in a back bedroom.
Real estate heiress Brinah Milstein Bank of the Milstein Properties family in New York and her husband, reality TV producer Roy Bank, have sued the City of Los Angeles for their alleged right to bulldoze a Spanish hacienda-style home at 12305 5th Helena Drive,
Business Insider reported
.
The Banks bought the first and last home owned by the Hollywood siren in July for
$8.35 million.
They bought the house next door, a 6,000-square-foot dwelling at 12306 6th Helena Drive, in 2016 for $8.2 million.
But their plans to raze the 2,900-square-foot Monroe home to make room to expand their house next door created an international outcry — and an order by the city to temporarily stave off the wrecking ball.
Days after
reports surfaced
that the century-old home faced demolition, the Los Angeles City Council in September rushed through a motion to consider
designating the property a historic cultural monument
, a move that would invalidate the demolition permits.
The City Council will vote on whether to declare the house a historic cultural monument by mid-June.
In a written statement to
The Real Deal
, Milstein and Bank’s attorney Peter Sheridan alleged the city “engaged in an illegal and unconstitutional conspiracy” involving government officials and tour operators and violated the law “with regards to the quasi-judicial process required for evaluation of alleged historic cultural monuments.”
Monroe bought the one-story, four-bedroom home in early 1962 for $77,500 — or roughly $790,000 in 2023 dollars — after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller. Less than six months later, the 36-year-old actress was found dead from a drug overdose in her bedroom.
Its front step tiles read “Cursum Perficio” — Latin for “my journey ends here.”


The Banks contend the house has been “substantially altered” since Monroe’s death, according to their complaint.
“There is not a single piece of the house that includes any physical evidence that Ms. Monroe ever spent a day at the house, not a piece of furniture, not a paint chip, not a carpet, nothing,” the lawsuit states.
The Banks claim they were issued a demolition permit from the city, which was initially “held” for 30 days to allow for objections.
No objections were raised and permits were subsequently issued, they say, which led to them incurring more than $30,000 in expenses before receiving an actual notice of a “stay” invoked by the city.
Their lawsuit also alleges that the city’s push for the designation violated its own codes, which has deprived the plaintiffs of their “vested rights as owners of real property” and has caused them “irreparable harm.”
Liz Waytkus, the U.S. executive director of the conservation nonprofit Docomomo, told
Dezeen
last month that the demolition highlighted a “systemic” problem in the area.
“The land has become more valuable than the house, and even if people understand the value of such a home, location and land value often trump architectural significance,” she said.
Correction: Previous story incorrectly identified Milstein and Bank.

The original home improvement star, Bob Vila, sold a non-waterfront Palm Beach home for $13.4 million, less than a year after paying $12.5 million for it.
Records show Vila and his wife, Diana Barrett, sold the house at 345 Pendleton Lane to Delphine Krakoff. Krakoff is the wife of Reed Krakoff, a fashion designer and the former creative director of Coach.
Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing, and Dana Koch of the Corcoran Group brought the buyer.


Vila was the star of the renovation shows “This Old House,” “Bob Vila’s Home Again,” and “Bob Vila.” His wife is a former Harvard Business School professor.
They bought the Pendleton Lane house for $12.5 million in December. Built in 1937 on a quarter-acre, the house spans 4,300 square feet, with four bedrooms, four bathrooms and one half-bathroom. It was designed by John Volk, a prominent early Palm Beach architect, according to the listing.
Vila and Barrett listed it for $15.9 million in May, Redfin shows.
The couple’s primary address is listed as 690 Island Drive, a waterfront Everglades Island home in Palm Beach that they’ve had listed for a year. It hit the market asking $52.9 million last November, but they relisted it for $39.9 million in September, according to Realtor.com. Angle has the listing. The Pendleton Lane sale closes just as
Palm Beach
’s busy season begins. Agents say market activity has surged since former president Donald Trump clinched the presidency earlier this month. Louise Riggio, the widow of Barnes &amp; Noble founder Leonard Riggio, sold her oceanfront compound for
$81 million
earlier this month. Also this month, spec developer Todd Glaser sold a waterfront renovated home to billionaire Herbert Wertheim for
$38 million

“Goodbye Peachtree Road” doesn’t have the same ring to it, but Elton John is departing from his Atlanta home after receiving a rocket of an offer.
The legendary British musician sold his condo at the Park Place on Peachtree for $7.2 million, the Wall Street Journal
reported
. He owned the unit for decades, but his need for it likely waned after John wrapped up his worldwide farewell tour.
It’s remarkable John is still standing after being blown away by the anonymous purchaser’s offer. John listed the unit only a few weeks ago, asking $5 million for the condo. He received a 45 percent premium on the listing price in a deal that works out to roughly $535 per square foot.
John initially purchased a 2,500-square-foot duplex in the building in 1992 before tacking on five apartments over the succeeding years. The 40-story building has 256 units in total.
The 13,500-square-foot, four-bedroom unit generated plenty of interest right away, according to the
listing
agent. Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby’s International Realty’s Chase Mizell said the local buyer paid in cash. Mizell added the apartment was deliberately underpriced in the hope buyers would bid the price up.


The unit includes a gym, massage room and a unique floorplan. There are large open spaces that John used to showcase his photography collection. It’s unclear if the buyer has their own collection of art, but there’s certainly room to display it. The deal also comes with nine reserved parking spaces, six private storage units and five wine storage units.
Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby’s International Realty’s Betsky Akers represented the buyer.
Two years ago, John and his husband David Furnish
paid $8.5 million
for the property adjacent to their longtime, $7.3 million home in Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills. They bought a 20-acre estate in Bel Air for $33 million in 2015 and previously owned two condo units at the Sierra Towers in West Hollywood.
The couple also owns properties in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy.

The Beckhams are expanding their roots in South Florida.
Retired soccer superstar and Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham and fashion designer and artist Victoria Beckham are buying the waterfront mansion at 4736 North Bay Road in Miami Beach, sources told
The Real Deal
. The 14,270-square-foot, nine-bedroom estate is on the market for
$80 million
.
Property records show developer Niklas de la Motte hired Bart Reines to build the spec home on the 0.6-acre lot. It has nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa, home theater, 124 feet of water frontage, a pool and outdoor kitchen and lounge, according to previous descriptions of the property. It’s nearly completed or was recently completed, according to sources.
Dora Puig, owner and broker of Luxe Living Realty, is the listing agent. She could not be reached for comment.
Choeff Levy Fischman designed the house with Antrobus Design Collection.


The listing was marked pending on the Multiple Listing Service on Monday.
David Beckham
is an owner of the Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami CF. He and his partners, led by MasTec Chairman Jorge Mas, are developing a major mixed-use soccer complex on the former Melreese golf course site near Miami International Airport. Beckham had been working on bringing MLS soccer to Miami for years before the team’s inaugural season in 2020. Since then, they have brought on players who include soccer great Lionel Messi.
The Beckhams own a full-floor condo at the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum tower in downtown Miami. They
paid about $19.8 million
for the 10,000-square-foot unit in 2020. It’s not currently on the market.
Motte
paid $10 million
for the North Bay Road property in 2018, which then included an older home. The new home has been on the market since November 2022.
North Bay Road has benefitted from the ultra luxury boom in Miami Beach.  Billionaire media mogul Barry Diller, who is married to fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, paid a
record $45 million
for the waterfront 1.5-acre lot at 5930 North Bay Road.
Earlier this month, spec developer Francisco Perez sold the waterfront mansion at 5310 North Bay Road
for $23.3 million
to a land trust, following a series of price reductions. That home sits on a 0.3-acre lot, records show.

The Piano Man finally found a buyer for one of his oceanfront homes.
Billy Joel sold his oceanfront Manalapan mansion for $42.6 million, after listing the estate on and off for six years.
Joel’s 1110 South Ocean LLC sold the estate at 1110 South Ocean Boulevard, according to listing sites. The new deed has yet to register in public records and the buyer is unknown.
Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate represented both the buyer and seller in the deal.
The five-time Grammy Award winner and “Uptown Girl” and “Piano Man” singer is a longtime South Florida resident. In 2006, he flipped a waterfront Miami Beach house for
$3.6 million
.


He bought the Manalapan estate for $22.1 million in 2015, records show. Built in 2010 on 1.6 acres, the mansion spans nearly 13,400 square feet, according to property records. It has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a theater, pub room and library, according to records and the listing. The estate includes a two-bedroom guest house, a 12-car garage, a pool and 150 feet of frontage on both the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, the listing shows.
Joel first listed the estate for
$31.9 million
in 2018. He delisted and relisted it several times in subsequent years, asking as much as $64.9 million for the compound at the South Florida market’s pandemic peak. It returned to the market in January asking $54.9 million, and the asking price got a haircut to $49.9 million in March.
Earlier this year, reports speculated that Joel was likely the hidden buyer in the January purchase of a waterfront Boca Raton mansion for
$29 million
, which briefly held the title of the city’s priciest home.
Agents say demand has picked up for luxury homes in
Manalapan
, many of which have the benefit of water frontage on both the ocean and Intracoastal Waterway, allowing homeowners beach access and dock facilities for their boats. Manalapan estates are larger and less expensive than comparable homes in nearby Palm Beach.
Many say Manalapan is poised for new prominence in South Florida’s ultra-luxury sector. Billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison
dropped $277.4 million
on the town’s Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa in August and is set to open a Nobu restaurant there in the coming months, according to published reports.
Joel, for his part, is looking to unload some of his most significant real estate holdings. Earlier this month, he listed his oceanfront estate on Long Island’s Oyster Bay for $49.9 million, according to
published reports
.

Ye, the rapper and music producer formerly known as Kanye West, has found a possible buyer for his unfinished Malibu home, making it last week’s top property under contract in the Los Angeles County luxury residential market.
The beachfront home has been up for sale since January, when it was listed for $53 million. In April, the Tadao Ando-designed house was
reduced
to $39 million. A restoration will be required by the next owner, given the home has been stripped of all interior finishes, according to the listing from The Oppenheim Group’s Jason Oppenheim.
The home is roughly 4,000 square feet with four bedrooms and five baths. It’s made of about 1,200 tons of concrete and 200 tons of steel reinforcement, the listing said.
Ye’s property at 24844 Malibu Road was the largest contract inked between July 22 and July 28, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report LA. The Eklund-Gomes report counts all signed contracts in the MLS listed above $4 million in Los Angeles County.


The Malibu Road house is one of 16 total signed contracts for the week ended July 28, which is down from 19 in the prior week. The 16 contracts reflect single-family deals with total volume of $136.6 million, which is up slightly from the prior week’s $132 million.
Last week’s second-largest contract is 543 Perugia Way in Holmby Hills, listed at $13.7 million. The five-bed, seven-bath home totals 9,615 square feet and sits on more than half an acre.
Carolwood Estates’ Linda May and Guy Levy have the listing. The seller is a trust tied to philanthropist couple Dr. Rafael Mendez and his wife Sharyl Mendez, according to property records.
The Tudor-style home built in 1932 has views of the Bel-Air Country Club Golf Course. It first hit the market for $17.5 million in October.

Retired Yankee shortstop turned real estate investor Alex Rodriguez sold a waterfront lot on Miami Beach’s Star Island back to billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Rodriguez
, chairman and CEO of Miami-based A-Rod Corp, sold the nearly 1-acre property at 14 Star Island Drive back to the Citadel founder and CEO for $45.5 million, according to sources. Rodriguez, who was first spotted on the island when he was engaged to Jennifer Lopez, planned to hire a world-renowned architect to design a 20,000-square-foot mansion on the lot.
Griffin
had acquired the property in 2020 for $24 million, then sold the lot to Rodriguez a year ago for $18.5 million, records show. But that price alone is likely misleading. The property was part of a land swap between the two that included the adjacent estate at 13 Star Island Drive, sources said. Rodriguez and Lopez
paid $32.5 million
for that estate in 2020. Griffin now controls both.
The sales of those properties were brokered by Jill Hertzberg and Jill Eber of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker; Rodriguez’s sister, Arlene Susy Dunand; and Ryan Mendell of Maxwelle Real Estate.
Griffin has been assembling land on
Star Island
, a man-made island just off of the MacArthur Causeway in Miami Beach, since 2020. He also collected residential properties in Palm Beach over the last decade-plus. On a piece of his Palm Beach assemblage, he is building a waterfront estate for his mother. His Citadel and Citadel Securities relocated from Chicago to Miami, where Griffin plans a waterfront
supertall commercial tower
in Brickell where both sister companies will be based.


The latest deal with Rodriguez gives Griffin nearly 6.5 acres of contiguous land on Star Island. That’s larger than billionaire Phillip and Patricia Frost’s estate at 21 Star Island Drive. And now just one other property owner stands between Griffin and the Frosts: Frayda Lindemann’s home at 15 Star Island Drive. (Lindemann is the widow of billionaire businessman George Lindemann.)
Griffin owns
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 Star Island Drive, which are on the west side of Star Island. He also paid about
$107 million
last year for Adrienne Arsht’s estate in Coconut Grove, where he proposed moving a historic structure off the property.
Other recent deals on Star Island include Dentek founder John Jansheski’s sale of his estate at 27 Star Island Drive for
$57 million
in September; and rapper
Rick Ross
’ purchase of 37 Star Island Drive for $35 million in August. Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Lennar Corporation Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller, billionaire LoanDepot founder and CEO Anthony Hsieh and plastic surgeon Leonard Hochstein, also known as the “Boob God,” all own homes on the gated island.
Rodriguez, who lives near Coral Gables, has invested in a handful of developments in South Florida. His Monument Capital Management, which is part of the A-Rod Corp umbrella of companies, recently raised more than $75 million for a fifth multifamily fund that’s expected to acquire $300 million in properties in the Sun Belt and Midwestern U.S.

Albert Pujols has sold his 9,200-square-foot mansion in Irvine’s Shady Canyon for $8.8 million, after initially asking $9.98 million.
The retired first baseman and 11-time MLB All-Star sold the Mediterranean-style villa at 25 Cactus, in gated Shady Canyon,
Realtor.com reported.
The buyer was undisclosed.
The slugger known as “The Machine” bought the five-bedroom, eight-bathroom house in 2012 for $5.55 million after he signed a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels.
Pujols initially
put the L-shaped mansion on the market
in 2016 for $7.75 million, but it never sold, according to Realtor.com.
He then listed the half-acre estate in January last year for $9.98 million and
found a buyer that didn’t close the deal
, according to Zillow.
The property was relisted and removed for that price in March, June and August, with a contingent deal in October, then removed in February at $9.98 million. It sold on March 5 in an apparent off-market deal for $1.18 million less.
The two-story, red-tiled mansion, built in 2010, has a double-height foyer with a curved wooden staircase and white tiled floors. There’s a luxury kitchen, multiple living rooms, a formal dining room and a laundry room.


The home comes with two offices, a movie theater, a wet bar and a meditation room. There’s also a bonus room that could be turned into a wine cellar, kid’s playroom or home gym, according to Realtor.com.
The kitchen has a marble center island, wood cabinets, a walk-in pantry and a breakfast nook. A formal dining room has a coffered ceiling and doors that open to the backyard. Sitting areas have stone fireplaces, beamed ceilings and wooden shutters.
The master bedroom has a wall of windows, a spa-style bathroom with a center tub, two walk-in closets and a laundry room.
Outside, there’s a resort-style pool with a Baja step, a rock slide grotto and a waterfall, plus a Jacuzzi, fire pit and patios surrounded by gardens, with a four-car garage. The monthly HOA fee is $725.
Brokers Charisse Okamoto and Carrie English of Caliber Real Estate held the listing.
Shady Canyon features 300 homes on nearly 1,100 acres. The large lots coupled with a sense of privacy has prompted athletes, executives and others to call Shady Canyon home, including best-selling author Dean Koontz and Alteryx Executive Chairman Dean Stoecker.
Pujols, a native of the Dominican Republic, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1999, and went on to play for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the L.A. Dodgers before retiring as a Cardinal in 2022, having won two World Series, two Golden Glove Awards and socked 703 home runs.

Three years since the NBA Hall of Famer reached an agreement to sell the property to Hacopian Design &amp; Development, the deal is mired in legal scuffles over payments and blame for the soured trade.
The property at the center of the dispute sits on about 7 acres at 27715 Pacific Coast Highway. Garnett sold it partially completed.
Now, as a two-year-old lawsuit against the buyer winds its way through Los Angeles Superior Court, a new complaint was filed in June against the title and escrow companies involved in the transaction.
Under terms of the 2021 sale, buyer Ando Hacopian of Hacopian Design &amp; Development Group agreed to handle Garnett’s closing costs and any prior liens. Meanwhile, Garnett was expected to walk away with $6 million, including $2 million in cash at closing. An LLC managed by Garnett would carry two, $2 million notes. One was secured at 7 percent interest and would sit junior to an $11 million loan provided by Marquee Funding Group. The second note was unsecured and payable after the property was completed and resold, according to the purchase agreement submitted with court documents.
Garnett’s lawsuit against the title and escrow companies alleges Hacopian is a “fraudster of the highest order” and that Closing Agents Escrow and its CEO, along with First American Title Company, turned a blind eye to the alleged fraud.
Closing Agents Escrow CEO Judith Sender, a spokesperson for First American Title and Hacopian –– who is the defendant in a separate lawsuit brought by Garnett — did not respond to a request for comment.
Garnett claims Hacopian said half of the $2 million due at closing was required to be held in escrow, according to the most recent lawsuit.
“The fact is, Hacopian did not have the necessary funds to close and lied to induce me to close rather than to call a default,” Garnett said in a declaration last year for the separate dispute against the buyer.


Garnett goes on to say a statement provided as proof of a $5.5 million balance for Hacopian was later confirmed through a subpoena with a balance of $50.
Attorneys for Garnett in the latest lawsuit allege Hacopian duped a second party in VIG Private Lending, which agreed to finance a secondary $2 million loan toward the purchase price in exchange for nearly $4 million in cash at closing. The agreement pushed Garnett’s note to a third deed of trust position, which the basketball star contends occurred without his knowledge.
When Hacopian allegedly defaulted on the VIG loan, the lender foreclosed, triggering the loss of Garnett’s unsecured note.
Hacopian said in his own declaration last year he was under the impression that if he found financing to pay VIG, the property would be sold back to him.
“I put all potential deals that I had been working on aside and focused on this project once again with the understanding that if I held my end of the bargain so would the foreclosing lender,” Hacopian’s declaration said.
He went on to claim he found financing in late 2022, but VIG “went silent.”
Ultimately, attorneys for Garnett argue in the latest lawsuit the alleged fraud would not have worked without the escrow and title companies being “involved in this entire charade.”
The latest lawsuit seeks to-be-determined damages, including interest and attorney fees.

Title: “Fresh Prince” producer’s Beverly Hills home lists for more than $22M
Subhead: David Salzman’s estate once hosted a fundraiser for presidential candidate Al Gore

A nearly 10,000-square-foot mansion owned by veteran TV producer David Salzman has debuted on the market for almost $23 million, or $2,306 per square foot,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Based on more than half an acre, the home is located at 702 North Sierra Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats enclave.
It was the site of a fundraiser for the Al Gore presidential campaign in 1999. Quincy Jones was a frequent guest, as well as financier Michael Milken, said Jade Mills of Coldwell Banker Realty. She is co-listing the home with Drew Fenton of Carolwood Estates and Ari Afshar of Compass.
Salzman’s successful career in television included serving as president for Lorimar-Telepictures which produced the shows “Dallas” and “Falcon Crest.” At Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment, Salzman produced sitcoms such as “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.”


Salzman  and his wife are moving to downsize. In the past 30 years, they remodeled some parts of the home, such as the kitchen, Mills said. The eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom home also features a basement, a tennis court, a guest house and grounds with 150 trees.
Mills said the market for mansions still generates activity despite headwinds. “The upper end of the market is OK; it is still moving,” she added.
The last time that 702 North Sierra was on the market dates back to 1993 when Salzman bought the three-level home off-market for an undisclosed price.

Indie actress Parker Posey is parting with her Chelsea triplex.
Posey — best known for her roles in “Dazed and Confused” and “Best in Show” — sold her apartment at 365 West 19th Street to a data analyst for just under $1.7 million, according to public records. She purchased the one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op for $1.5 million in 2019.
“With work taking me out of the city so much, I simply couldn’t give what it deserved,” Posey told the
New York Post
in June and added that she’s spending more time upstate.
The actress listed the unit for just under $2 million in September 2022 before removing it last December, according to StreetEasy. The apartment hit the market again in May with the same asking price, which was lowered to $1.75 million in October.
Earlier this year, she described the apartment as a “bird’s house” or a “birdhouse with a nest on top.”


The home has a private roof terrace as well as a double-height living room with exposed brick walls, curved half moon windows and frosted glass walls. It also includes a spiral staircase leading to the primary suite, which features a skylight and clawfoot bathtub.
Matthew Coleman of Coleman Real Estate Group had the listing.
Unit 3F is one of seven residences in the building, built in 1910 and featuring designs by artist Robert Ostro. Recent deals for apartments in the boutique co-op range from roughly $680,000 to just under $2 million.
Posey’s home’s return to the market this summer coincided with the re-release of the movie “Party Girl” — a 1995 flick with Posey starring as a 20-something East Village party girl named Mary.
The actress’ more recent pursuits include a role alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Nathan Lane and Patti LuPone in Ari Aster’s “Beau Is Afraid.” She’s also in several upcoming TV shows, including an Amazon Prime reboot of “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith” and “The Parenting” with Brian Cox and Lisa Kudrow.

The creator of the Jack Reacher series is moving to the Upper West Side.
British author James Dover Grant — known for penning the adventure novels under the name Lee Child — paid $17 million, or $2,215 per square foot, for a townhouse at 25 West 88th Street, according to public records.
The sellers, real estate investment banker Kurt Roeloffs and his wife Shyanne, bought the five-story home for $5.4 million in 2011. At the time, it was configured as a multifamily property with a quadraplex and four one-bedroom units.
Since then, the couple underwent a significant renovation to combine the units into a single-family home sprawling 8,000 square feet, six bedrooms and six bathrooms. As part of the renovation, the two added a high-speed elevator and updates to the home’s facade, including a new stoop.
The Roeloffs partnered with Baxt/Ingui Architects to convert the home into a LEED-certified
passive house
designed to reduce energy consumption and enhance air quality. The home is outfitted with hospital-grade air filters, solar panels and triple-filtration water system.
“The point was to do a renovation that was more sustainable, highly effective and that didn’t make any compromises,” Shyanne Roeloffs said.
She added that the purpose was to reduce construction waste, which included donating appliances and sourcing materials locally. The backyard fence was constructed using some of the home’s original materials as well as recycled wood from the Coney Island boardwalk.
The landmarked brownstone, built in 1889, also features a 500-bottle wine cellar, a terrace with an outdoor fireplace, a yoga, dance and entertainment studio and an eat-in kitchen.


The listing describes the home as “
triple mint
,” which means its kitchen, bathroom and overall condition are pristine, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan wrote in Forbes in 2018.
Roeloffs said the couple invested heavily in the renovation with expectations to stay in the home for years, but they ultimately chose to move to the U.K. to pursue higher education opportunities and to be closer to family.
“It’s a bit of a shame to have put so much heart and soul into a place,” Roeloffs said.
The Roeloffs first listed the home for $19 million in 2016 before pulling it off the market and relisting it for $17.5 million in 2021. The townhouse hit the market again last April with an asking price of $18 million.
Leslie J. Garfield’s Richard Pretsfelder and Thomas Wexler had the listing.
Renovated townhouses are the market’s “sweet spot” right now, though there aren’t many of them on the market, according to Pretsfelder. He added that though activity in the neighborhood has been strong, he’s expecting transactions to continue to pick up.
Kurt Roeloffs is the former head of Deutsche Bank’s real estate investment banking arm in Asia. He now serves as the global chief investment officer of RREEF and as the chairman of Seaforth Land, a London-based developer focused on restoring commercial real estate in the city.
Shyanne Roeloffs is a PhD candidate studying the psychology of hunger at Anglia Rustin University in Cambridge.

NFL legend Tom Brady’s former Surfside, Florida condo, has hit the market for $16 million.
Located in the upscale Fendi Château Residences tower, the lavish three-bedroom, five-bathroom unit served as Brady’s residence following his split from supermodel Gisele Bündchen in November 2022 and during his final year with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before his retirement in February,
the New York Post reported
.
Situated on the tower’s ninth floor, the 4,100-square-foot unit offers a glimpse into Brady’s luxury lifestyle, commanding $60,000 per month during his stay.
The listing is managed by Mendel Fellig with Compass.
With views of the Atlantic Ocean, the condo is designed for entertainment and exclusivity, accessible via a private elevator.
The interior features 10-foot-high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows with views onto the ocean.


Built in 2016, the Fendi Chateau Residences tower houses only 58 units, offering residents a host of upscale amenities.
Chateau Group completed the
12-story, 57-unit Fendi Château in 2016
. The building was designed by Arquitectonica, and units range from three bedrooms spanning more than 3,000 square feet to three penthouses spanning more than 7,000 square feet.
For a monthly condo fee of $8,899, residents can enjoy “white glove services,” access to a fitness center with a spa, an in-house salon, a residents-only restaurant, and a kid’s club.
For those seeking to experience a taste of Brady’s former lifestyle, the property is also available for lease at a higher monthly rate of $75,000 as of early December. It’s the only unit in the building offering leasing as an option.
Both Brady and Bündchen call South Florida their home and have owned several properties together and separately in recent years.
Before the divorce, they rented a four-bedroom, 4,300-square-foot waterfront home at 29 Indian
Creek Island Road
on Indian Creek.

Netflix’s “Owning Manhattan” is heading back to the small screen.
The streaming service announced on Tuesday that it would renew the series following Ryan Serhant and his four-year-old eponymous brokerage for a second season.
Variety
first reported the news.
The announcement comes two months after the first eight-episode season premiered and rose to the forefront of Netflix’s catalog. The platform ranked the series among the top 10 TV shows worldwide for a week and among the top 10 in the country for two weeks. It also landed among 10 most-streamed shows in 30 countries.
One of the main storylines in “Owning Manhattan” centers on Ryan attempting to sell a trophy penthouse at Extell Development’s Central Park Tower, then asking $250 million, before his exclusive agreement ran out. However, the listing was
pulled off the market
in the month after the series’ premiere.


Also featured in the show was the penthouse at 527 West 27th Street, a 36-unit building in Chelsea known as Jardim. The four-bedroom apartment sold for
$15 million
in May, after it was rented by rapper Bad Bunny for $150,000 a month last year.
Though Serhant’s series got the greenlight, Netflix
canceled
another of its real estate reality shows “Buying Beverly Hills” after two seasons. The show follows agents at The Agency, headed by Mauricio Umansky, who made his reality TV debut years earlier as the husband of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” co-star Kyle Richards. (The couple has since split.)
At the time of its premiere, “Owning Manhattan” was the only real estate reality TV show  on Netflix focused solely on New York City, though another is expected to join its ranks. Earlier this summer, the platform announced that a group of Douglas Elliman agents based in the Big Apple would star in a new series called “
Selling the City
.”
The show marks the third spin-off from the “Selling” franchise, which created the hit series “Selling Sunset,” which is often credited with putting real estate reality TV back on the map after its premiere in 2019. Other series in the franchise focus on agents in Orange County and Tampa.

Spec developer Todd Glaser teamed up with his neighbor, Warhol muse Baby Jane Holzer, to buy the house between their Palm Beach properties for $15.5 million.
The pair bought the house at 111 Via Del Lago from the estate of the late Ned Monell Jr., Glaser confirmed. They split the cost evenly, and plan to demolish the existing home and use the property to expand their adjacent homes, he said.
Glaser and his wife, interior designer Kim Glaser, relocated from Miami Beach to
Palm Beach
in recent years and bought their home at 125 Via Del Lago for
$23.2 million
in 2022.
Glaser
and his partners have invested heavily in Palm Beach spec homes and flipping properties in recent years. In May, they sold Tarpon Island for
$152 million
, making it one of the most expensive homes ever sold in Florida.
Holzer, a lifelong Palm Beacher, is also active in the island’s real estate game. Her portfolio spans residential and commercial properties across Palm Beach County, and includes the building at  247 Worth Avenue, home of the French restaurant and island mainstay, Le Bilboquet, records show.
Before she was a landlord, though, Holzer was a socialite, model, and famous friend of Andy Warhol. She was the subject of a number of his works, several of which remain in her personal art collection.


Holzer bought the half-acre property at 980 South Ocean Boulevard, which is adjacent to 111 Via Del Lago, for $8 million in 2020, records show. She tore down the existing home and
plans to build a new mansion
on the land.
Glaser said local attorney Maura Ziska told him the house at 111 Via Del Lago would be sold after Monell, the grandson of Gilded Age nickel magnate Ambrose Monell, died. Glaser then approached Holzer about splitting the property.
“She thought it was a great idea,” he said. He thought about buying the property himself, he said, but decided it was “overkill.”
Now he plans to add a guest house and a garden on the east side of his combined properties.
Buying up neighboring properties
has become a common practice in South Florida’s luxury market, where wealthy buyers often cobble together two, three or more lots to assemble larger estates.

Drew Barrymore didn’t need “50 First Dates” to find a buyer for her Hamptons farmhouse.
Barrymore is offloading her place at 16 Old Barn Lane in Sagaponack only three weeks
after listing
the estate, the New York Post
reported
. The deal has yet to close, so the buyer’s identity and the purchase price are unclear, but Barrymore was asking $8.5 million, or nearly $1,241 per square foot.
Barrymore purchased the home in 2019 for $5.5 million, and then did an extensive remodeling for the 6,850-square-foot century-old house.
There are seven bedrooms and six bathrooms between the main house and the small guest cottage; several bedrooms are ensuite and some have adjoining decks and balconies. The main home also has built-in bookcases, a brick fireplace and French doors that open to the grounds.
Those grounds feature a pool, pool house, bocce ball court and multiple lounging areas, situated within a mile of the ocean.


Sotheby’s International Realty’s Kathy Konzet has the listing.


Barrymore is known for her roles in movies such as “E.T.,” “The Wedding Singer” and “Fever Pitch,” along with the Netflix series “Santa Clarita Diet.” Since 2020, she’s hosted her own talk show on CBS, though she stirred up controversy when she tried to bring the program back on the air amid the Writers Guild of America strike, leading to a public apology.
In April, more homes
were listed
in the Hamptons and the North Fork than during the same month last year, according to Miller Samuel’s report for Douglas Elliman. In the Hamptons, new listings increased 41 percent annually, rising from 92 to 130, while new signed contracts remained stagnant between the two periods.

The daughter of the late Marvel comic book creator Stan Lee has put her gift estate in the Hollywood Hills on the market for $8.8 million.
And for a few bucks extra, she’ll include some life-sized Spidermen.
JC Lee, an actor, writer and producer, has listed the 5,300-square-foot house given to her by her parents at 1668 Rising Glen Road, in the Bird Streets,
the New York Post reported
.
The long-time comic book writer and his wife, Joan Lee, died in 2018 and 2017, respectively. They were both 95.
The three-bedroom, seven-bathroom property above the Sunset Strip was the last property Stan Lee ever bought, according to the tabloid. He paid $4.4 million for the half-acre estate in 2014.
“My father and I loved this house at first sight,” JC Lee told The Post in a statement. “There were so many possibilities, we couldn’t wait to get started.
“This house was made for parties and entertaining with a sound system that extends to the showers, the theater and the cabana designed to keep food hot for outdoor events.”


The white single-story house, built in 1958, has two black columns flanking its front door, topped by crown moldings above low white barriers and lush landscaping.
The foyer flows into a den equipped with a built-in bar and fireplace. A photo with the Post story depicts the entrance with three life-size Spidermen, accompanied by a caption stating they are “available for separate purchase.” The price of the statues was not disclosed. Stan Lee co-created the character Spiderman in 1962.
The house also has a formal living room, large dining room, a kitchen with a center island, two guest rooms, and an office. The home movie theater features a bathroom, red carpet and plush seats.
The master bedroom has two walk-in closets and a fireplace, sauna and two bathrooms.
Outside, behind tall hedges, there’s a pool, spa, cabana and a paved upper deck.

Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos paid $90 million for a waterfront estate in exclusive Indian Creek Village, less than a year after purchasing two waterfront properties on the island for $147 million.
That brings his total spending to $237 million in Indian Creek. The guard-gated island, where the streets are private and only residents and invited guests are allowed, is north of Miami Beach.
Bezos
, who ceremoniously announced his move to the Miami area last fall, acquired the 10,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom mansion at 28 Indian Creek Island Road,
Bloomberg
reported.
Fellow Indian Creek residents include billionaire Carl Icahn, hedge funder Eddie Lampert,
Tom Brady
,
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner
, and singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias.
Bezos’ latest, a nearly 2-acre property, includes a pool and dock. The house was built in 1956 and expanded in 1986 and 2014, property records show.


Javier Holtz, a former banker, is the seller of the home. Holtz paid $2.5 million for the property in 1998.
Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, have been looking for a move-in ready mansion while he has a new estate built on the nearby properties at 11 and 12 Indian Creek Island Road, sources told
The Real Deal.
The adjacent lots have homes on them that Bezos will have demolished.
In October, Bezos
paid $79 million
for the nearly 2-acre estate at 12 Indian Creek in a deal brokered by Dina Goldentayer and Danilo Tavares of Douglas Elliman. Months earlier, Bezos
paid $68 million
for the adjacent mansion. That sale was brokered by Sohely van Woerkom of Golden Ocean Real Estate, led by Gabriela Espejo.
Bezos is worth about $194 billion, according to Forbes, and is typically either the second or third richest person in the world. He went to high school in Miami, graduating from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1982. In 2022, his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, purchased
two waterfront homes
in Coral Gables for $78 million.

Sale Price (int): nan


Content:
Nine years ago, Annie Leibovitz probably couldn’t picture selling her Upper West Side duplex for significantly less than she paid for it.
The famed photographer put her
co-op
on the market for $8.6 million, the New York Times
reported
. Leibovitz purchased the unit at the Brentmore at 88 Central Park West
for $11.3 million
in 2014.
The unit is 3,500 square feet, breaking down an asking price of $2,457 per square foot.
The UWS unit has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. It’s on the fifth and sixth floors of the 12-story building, which has been the home to celebrities including Robert De Niro, Paul Simon and Sting.
The pad overlooks Central Park, a motivator when Leibovitz first saw the apartment a decade ago. Leibovitz updated the apartment after purchasing it, though many pre-war details remain. Monthly maintenance for the unit is $10,307.
Amenities at the Brentmore include a doorman, private storage space and a gym. The Corcoran Group’s Deborah Kern has the
listing
.


Leibovitz told the outlet she is ready to move on because her children are out of school and her work is downtown; last year, she purchased a full-floor condo in the West Village for
$6.5 million
. Her family home, meanwhile, is upstate in Rhinebeck.
The downtown and Upstate properties were the subject of a nonpayment lawsuit against Leibovitz with in 2009. Lender Art Capital Group claimed the photographer was behind on hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid fees after borrowing $24 million. The parties reached
a settlement deal
that included Leibovitz purchasing the rights to act as exclusive agent in the sale of her real estate.
The co-op’s discount from nine years ago adds to recent evidence that the city’s
storied co-ops are losing
some of their luster. Trophy co-ops are either languishing on the market or selling for pennies on the dollar as wealthy buyers flock to condos with their fresher amenities and less restrictive entry requirements.
Co-ops’ widespread restrictions on financing have deterred buyers, along with a lack of opportunity to shield buyers’ identities while requiring meticulous financial disclosures and can often reject applicants without giving a reason, sparking accusations of discrimination.
Co-ops also often restrict how apartments are utilized. Renovations are more challenging to undertake as boards have a say over even the tiniest change.

He is also a longtime investor in consumer packaged goods brands, and co-founded the venture firm Cavu Consumer Partners with Brett Thomas in 2015. Its portfolio includes Oatly, Beyond Meat, Health-Ade Kombucha, Skinny Dipped, Osea, Poppi, Hims and Hers.


Keddell said the buyer plans to tear down the house and build a new home in the future, and that buyers these days are looking for large lots with good views. They’re also looking for newly constructed homes, which
are in short supply
.
He has also appeared as a “Guest Shark” on Shark Tank intermittently since 2017.
Rudolf Budja owns his namesake gallery based in Miami Beach, which includes works by Damien Hurst, Franz West and Andy Warhol. His wife also works at the gallery.
They bought the West San Marino Drive home for $5 million in 2008, property records show. It was built on nearly 0.4 acres in 1936 by prominent Art Deco architect L. Murray Dixon, the listing shows. It spans 3,800 square feet, with six bedrooms, four bathrooms, a pool and dock, according to property records. It has 90 feet of waterfront.
The Budjas first listed the home for $29 million in 2022, slashing the price four times before selling for $13.5 million.
Miami Beach’s
Venetian Islands
luxury market has been dominated by buyers seeking such turnkey homes in recent months. In April, a British investor bought a Max Strang-designed waterfront spec home for
$23.9 million
. In May, Clara Homes’ James Curnin sold an unfinished waterfront spec house for
$23.1 million
. Last month, a waterfront teardown on half an acre sold for
$27.5 million

Title: Inside South Florida’s ultra luxury resi market

Sitting on the couch in the staged living room of the Tarpon Island estate in Palm Beach, Todd Michael Glaser seemed befuddled.
“I don’t know why Tarpon hasn’t sold yet,” the spec developer said in February, shaking his head as he mused about the market between calls.
Tarpon is a 21,400-square-foot renovated megamansion, with 11 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, two kitchens, a home office, tennis court, gym, salon and spa, two pools, a hot tub and cold plunge, sitting on a 2.3-acre private island. It has room to fit staff, in-laws, a catering team and more. It should check all the boxes for the typical ultra-rich homebuyer.
In 2021, Glaser and his partners, Jim Randall, Scott Robins and Jonathan Fryd, bought the private island for
$85 million
. A year later they listed it for
$218 million
, with grandiose visions.  “This is a house for Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,” Glaser told
The Real Deal
at the time. After an unsuccessful first season, it returned to the market at the reduced price of $187.5 million.
Glaser’s luck changed about a month ago, when Tarpon went into contract. The sale is expected to close soon, and it will mark one of the priciest ever in Florida.
It also signifies the true start of the region’s busiest season. After a string of record years during the pandemic that were followed by a dropoff in sales, South Florida agents say this season is delayed and inconsistent, but
definitely still better
than other top luxury markets. Price cuts are spurring sales, as buyers are expected to jump into the market as summer approaches.
“We got a late start is really what it comes down to,” said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach. “There’s definitely been some momentum, but it ebbs and flows very oddly.”
As price reductions have become more common, the pricing gap between buyers and sellers of ultra-luxury homes in South Florida has narrowed, resulting in a boost in activity at the very high end over the last two-plus months. Each deal creates momentum for the next. But inventory is still wonky, agents say.
Housing analyst Jonathan Miller said the luxury market is in a “slow grind.” Pricing has fallen, but it’s still up, compared to pre-pandemic. High interest rates and elevated pricing are keeping sales below pandemic highs. And the upcoming election and slow summer season suggest the boost in activity could be short-lived.
In Miami Beach and other barrier island markets including Bal Harbour and Indian Creek, 10 luxury single-family home sales closed in the first quarter, up 25 percent from eight sales during the same period of last year, according to the Miller-authored
Douglas Elliman reports
. Still, the median price for luxury homes fell 28 percent to just over $13 million. The reports define luxury as the top 10 percent of deals. Inventory and months of supply also rose.
In Palm Beach, the overall number of single-family home sales and their median price each rose in the same time period. Isolating the top 10 percent of the market, luxury home and condo sales fell 10 percent to nine closings; and the median price fell 18 percent to $14 million.
“Part of this decline is attributable to a shift in the mix, in terms of what’s selling. Even though the median price is down, it’s still … higher than pre-pandemic,” Miller said. “The numbers are still elevated, but choppy.”
Market movers
South Florida’s major luxury deals were concentrated in Palm Beach and Miami Beach this season, though a handful of sales scattered across South Florida’s waterways are still setting records.
Even sales of vacant lots have picked up. Those deals are often more challenging because of the cost and time associated with building. Dora Puig, top broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, said teardowns and land sales are being “really negotiated.”
In April, billionaire Barry Diller
paid $45 million
for the 1.5-acre waterfront lot at 5930 North Bay Road, a record for the waterfront Miami Beach street. Nearby, an assemblage of waterfront land at 18 La Gorce Circle, asking $132 million, is in contract to two buyers after the price was reduced twice from the original $170 million asking price. Both of those deals include homes that the buyers are expected to tear down and replace with new mansions.
Buyers are looking at the usual areas: the Sunset and Venetian islands, North Bay Road, La Gorce, Star Island and Indian Creek, said top Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer.
Diller’s buy and billionaire Teddy Sagi’s pending
$24 million purchase
of a teardown at 4521 Pine Tree Drive show that buyers are willing to spend big money on vacant lots again.
“Two big sales is enough for everyone to be excited,” Goldentayer said.
In another private island deal, billionaire Jeff Bezos
dropped $90 million
on a third waterfront Indian Creek Village estate in March. The Amazon founder had been in the market for a home he could live in while he has a mansion built on a double lot on the island that he assembled last year for nearly $150 million.
The activity has spilled over to condos, too. In Surfside, a penthouse at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club
sold for $44 million
, a record $6,000 per square foot.


Goldentayer sees consistent demand for properties priced at $20 million and up.
“The demand continues [for] uber-wealthy new residents re-domiciling, and they want something special,” she said.
Brokers say they’re seeing multiple buyers expressing interest, especially following a price cut, but not necessarily pulling the trigger.
“In each of those markets, there seems to be a good number of buyers,” said Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, who is representing the seller in the pending La Gorce deal. “That doesn’t mean they’ll overpay.”
Aside from Tarpon Island, big Palm Beach deals include Nvidia board member Harvey Jones’
$74.3 million purchase
of a 1-acre lakefront estate, which closed in March. Earlier this month, a hidden buyer
dropped $85 million
to acquire Ideavillage founder Anand Khubani’s oceanfront 1-acre lot at 108 El Mirasol.
The deals that have closed are spurring more activity, agents say.
“It churns the soil up underneath, it electrifies things,” said Douglas Elliman’s Chris Leavitt, who is co-listing Tarpon Island. Pricey listings selling can “give the property down the street a little boost.”
Luxury lurkers
Prospective buyers are keeping a close eye on homes they’re interested in — sometimes by boat. When some such trophy properties go into contract, those who missed out want to be notified if the deal falls through.
They’re “a little bit nervous, waiting and hesitating and losing the property they want,” Hertzberg said. “But at the same time we’re not back to [the buying frenzy of] 2021.”
Miller referred to these buyers as “luxury lurkers.” They want to buy, but feel less urgency.
Puig said she has a waitlist of nine buyers who want to see her $80 million listing at 4736 North Bay Road, a waterfront estate under construction that developer Niklas de la Motte was building for himself.
Nelson Gonzalez, a top agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said “huge demand” still exists. “It’s just the very high-end buyers thinking the market is going to come down.”
Some properties are selling at record prices, and some are experiencing price cuts.
After a year on the market
asking $200 million
, cosmetics heir William Lauder slashed the price for two oceanfront lots in Palm Beach. Rather than sell them together, he’s now looking for two buyers at $88.9 million each. He also tapped Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate to take over the listing from Premier Estate Properties’ Jim McCann.
At the end of the day, the asking price is a test.
“It’s all over the board. I have denied some listings because of the seller’s desired asking price. I don’t want to waste my time or theirs,” said Elliman agent Samantha Curry. “There’s also some sellers that will say ‘I don’t know where the market is, so let’s try this number.’”
Brokers expect they’ll have a little more time to find the sweet spot on pricing this season. Given the slow start and recent burst of activity, deals could keep closing past Memorial Day.
“I anticipate this season trending later this year,” said Premier Estate Properties agent Margit Brandt, who is representing the buyer in the pending Tarpon Island deal. “There’ll be a lot of closings in June and July.”
Even with the extension, buyers and sellers are still rushing to get deals done before they head to their summer homes.
“There’s a major push right now,” Leavitt said. “It’s almost like a scurry to purchase before people leave.”

Title: Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry in legal flap for Montecito home purchase
Subhead: 83-year-old seller claims he was of “unsound mind” during deal
Authors: By TRD Staff

Subject Address: 1569 East Valley Road, Montecito, CA
Sale Price (text): $14.2 million
Sale Price (int): 14200000.0


Content:
Carl Westcott had just had surgery and was high on painkillers when he inked a contract to sell his Montecito home to singer Katy Perry and her husband, actor Orlando Bloom, for $15 million.
That’s the crux of a three-year-legal dispute that goes to trial this month to settle ownership of the 9,300-square-foot estate at 1569 East Valley Road,
the Daily Mail reported.
Westcott’s lawyers argue the contract to sell his home is “voidable” because of their client’s mental state. His family is now fighting the singer for control of their father’s $15 million estate.
In July 2020, the then 80-year-old military veteran with Huntington’s Disease said he had just undergone a six-hour back surgery and had taken opiates to numb the pain.
“The combination of his age, frailty from his back condition and recent surgery, and the opiates he was taking several times a day rendered Mr. Westcott of unsound mind,” according to a lawsuit.
Three days after he was released from the hospital, Bernie Gudvi, who represented Perry and Bloom, presented Westcott with a written offer for more than he had paid two months earlier for the eight-bedroom, 11-bath estate, according to his complaint.
The following day, Westcott signed a sales agreement prepared by Berkshire Hathaway.
The deal, reported at the time for
$14.2 million
, included a four-building compound in the Santa Ynez foothills built in the 1930s, then renovated by architect Lutah Maria Riggs. For Perry, born and raised in Santa Barbara, it was supposed to be a homecoming.


But Westcott’s lawyers argue the aging seller was “unable to understand the nature and probable consequences of his actions.” Days later, Westcott “started to feel mentally clear again” and realized the weight of his signature on the agreement, the complaint states.
Westcott then sent an email to Berkshire Hathaway, which represented the seller and buyer, saying that he didn’t want to sell — that he’d been under the influence of pain medication and was “in the final years of his life and cannot sell his home,” the lawsuit contends.
Two days later, the Westcott received a letter from a lawyer for Gudvi, Perry and Bloom, saying the couple was “not willing to walk away from purchasing Mr. Westcott’s home and he is obligated to complete the sale.”
Westcott, who served in the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division, is an entrepreneur with roots in Texas who owned numerous companies, including 1-800-Flowers.
Previously, Perry ran into another legal bramble when she tried to buy an 8-acre Los Angeles convent for a future home.
The pop star spent roughly two years
fighting a group of aging nuns
and a competing wannabe buyer, restaurateur Dana Hollister, for the former Waverly Place convent at 3431 Waverly Drive. An 89-year-old nun
died in the courtroom
.
After spending
$2.6 million in legal fees
, Perry acquired the property in 2016, with damages totaling more than $15 million.

A pending deal signed by baseball star Francisco Lindor led Manhattan’s luxury market last week.
The New York Mets’ shortstop is
purchasing a penthouse
at EJS Group’s 200 East 75th Street for roughly $20 million, making it the most expensive home to find a buyer between Dec. 9 and Dec. 15, according to Olshan Realty’s weekly report. The Wall Street Journal
first reported
news of the contract on Tuesday.
The six-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment last asked just under $23 million, according to a Streeteasy listing. Unit PH5 spans 5,300 square feet and has three terraces, 11-foot ceilings and a gas fireplace.
Alexa Lambert, Susan Wires and Marc Achilles with Compass’ new development marketing arm are heading sales at the building. Douglas Elliman’s Dan Benichou represented Lindor in the deal.
Sales at the development launched in March, and buyers have signed contracts for about half of its 36 units since then. Amenities at the 18-story building, where construction is slated for completion next year, include a fitness center, virtual sports room with a golf simulator and landscaped roof terrace.
The Upper East Side abode was one of 31 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals last week. The total was down from 34 contracts signed in the
previous period
.


The second priciest home to find a buyer was a penthouse at 56 Leonard Street, with an asking price just under $20 million. The 3,700-square-foot condo, which last traded for $17.3 million in 2018, hit the market in September. Unit PH52A has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and three terraces.
Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara of Compass’ Hudson Advisory Team had the listing.
Alexico Group’s and Hines’ 146-unit development, known as the “Jenga Building,” made headlines in 2021 after a buyer signed a contract for a duplex asking
$50 million
. At the time, it was the most expensive inked deal for a Downtown Manhattan penthouse so far that year.
Of the 31 properties, 24 were condos, four were co-ops, one was a condop and two were townhouses.
The homes’ combined asking price was $262 million, which works out to an average price of $8.5 million and a median of $6.9 million. The typical home spent nearly 550 days on the market and was discounted 7 percent from the original listing price.

Supermodel Elle Macpherson sold her mansion in Coral Gables for $18.5 million.
Bumda Trust, a hidden trust managed by an attorney, acquired the 8,935-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom home at 9550 Journeys End Road, property records show.
Macpherson
paid $8.1 million
for the 1.7-acre property in 2018. She listed it for sale two years ago
for $29 million
. It was most recently asking $22 million, according to the listing. Douglas Elliman’s Pablo Alfaro and Lourdes Alatriste were the listing agents. Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker represented the buyer.
Macpherson, an actress and businesswoman, was
previously married
to developer Jeffrey Soffer. They lived together in Indian Creek Village. She purchased the Journey’s End estate one year after their divorce was finalized.
The Coral Gables home is not waterfront but it includes a boat slip at the Journey’s End Marina. The property has a pool, home office, gym, a chef’s kitchen, and primary suite. It was renovated in 2017, according to the listing.


Journey’s End is a gated, waterfront community near other gated neighborhoods in Coral Gables such as Gables Estates and Cocoplum.
In August, Francisco Unanue, a scion of the family that founded and runs Goya Foods, sold a waterfront lot in Gables Estates
for $18.5 million
to a company managed by developer Alex Pirez.
Despite price reductions, many homes are selling for more than their previous sale prices.
In July, the CEO of a San Francisco-based lending firm and his wife, a vegan cosmetics company founder, sold their Gables Estates mansion
for $27.5 million
. They acquired the property in 2020 for $13.6 million.

Ng was also the first Asian American general manager in Major League Baseball history when she was hired by the Marlins in November 2020. She resigned in October of last year, in part because the Marlins wanted to hire a president of baseball operations above her, according to
ESPN
.
Ng and Markward sold the 3,400-square-foot
Coconut Grove
house for its asking price of $4.5 million, 40 percent more than their purchase price in 2021. The deed naming the buyer has not yet been recorded. The sellers renovated the home, including a new kitchen and flooring, according to the listing.


They paid $3.2 million for the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half home the same year it was completed. It sits on a quarter-acre lot.

Reggaeton and Latin trap artist Nicky Jam sold his downtown Miami condo at One Thousand Museum for a profit.
The singer-songwriter-rapper, whose real name is Nick Rivera Caminero, sold his 4,600-square-foot unit for $7 million. He bought the four-bedroom, five-bathroom condo in the fall of 2021 for
$5.7 million
, which means he likely sold it for a roughly $1 million profit after paying commissions. The luxury condo tower was designed by the late Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid.
Caminero, who has collaborated with Daddy Yankee, J Balvin and Enrique Iglesias, among others, sold unit 1602 at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard. Tony Rodriguez-Tellaheche of Prestige Realty Group was the listing agent. Patricia Subiris-Gonzalez of Shelton and Stewart Realtors represented the buyer.
Rodriguez-Tellaheche declined to name the buyer, but said the buyer is relocating from Sunny Isles Beach. Subiris-Gonzalez declined to comment.


The half-floor unit was on the market for $7.2 million. Caminero had converted two of the bedrooms into closets to house his shoe collection, Rodriguez-Tellaheche said. The building’s amenities include an aquatic center with a pool, a sky lounge and a rooftop helipad.
Caminero previously owned a Miami Beach home on Palm Island, which he sold three years ago for
$3.1 million
. Rodriguez-Tellaheche said he is working with Caminero to find a condo nearby in
downtown Miami

Other unit owners and part-time residents at One Thousand Museum include David and Victoria Beckham,

Real estate has always been about keeping the bad guys out.
In other eras, castles had moats and cities had walls. Security and privacy look different today, but for the moguls, titans of industry and uber celebrities buying luxury real estate in South Florida, it remains just as important as it was for the rulers and aristocrats of the past.
Take
Lionel Messi
. News broke in July that the soccer superstar signed a contract with Inter Miami for $60 million a year, inspiring a feverish Messi-mania across the tri-county region. Few celebrity home purchases have been more closely watched than Messi’s this summer. And everyone knew he would be focused on privacy and safety.
Messi is no stranger to South Florida –– he owns three condos in Sunny Isles Beach, including one at
Porsche Design Tower
, developed by Gil Dezer’s Dezer Development. He also rented a waterfront house in Key Biscayne during Covid, but that came with challenges for the uber celebrity: Fans came by boat to his dock, and police shut down his street, which was public.
This time, Messi was looking for a private, gated community. He looked in
Sea Ranch Lakes
, a tiny gated community that is walled in with its own police force and just over 200 homes. His teammate
Sergio Busquets
bought a waterfront home there for $8.7 million.
After a summer of wild speculation, Messi ultimately bought a waterfront mansion in another area, Bay Colony in Fort Lauderdale, for
$10.8 million
.
Just across the water from Sea Ranch Lakes,
Bay Colony
offers everything a security minded buyer would want. The gated luxury community has just over 100 lots, all of which are waterfront, and has round-the-clock security.
“They’re very, very tough about who comes in and out,” Douglas Elliman agent Hedy Tufo told
The Real Deal
.
While Messi is perhaps South Florida’s most high-profile buyer in pursuit of privacy and security lately, brokers say the attributes are an increasingly common request from clients.
“Security and privacy [are] at the height of what people want,” said Ruthie Assouline, an agent with Douglas Elliman’s Assouline Team.
Brokers say rising crime rates in other parts of the country are driving more security minded purchases in South Florida.
“The reality is that when you have people who are so security conscious and moving from certain states, like New York and California, their eyes are very wide open to potential security issues,” said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach.
Koch noted one of his clients recently bought a home in Bear’s Club, the uber private, gated golf community in Jupiter designed by Jack Nicklaus. Residents include celebrity athletes Michael Jordan and Rory McIlroy, and the entire community has only 100 home sites.
Many estates within Bear’s Club have their own gates. The homeowners association picks up garbage and delivers mail and packages so as to limit outsiders’ access. Guests are escorted to their final destination within the community by security guards.
This is what luxury buyers want, more and more, agents say.


“More so than ever we have clients saying, ‘We only want a gated community,’” Assouline said. “That makes people feel very secure in their home, knowing how closely everything is being watched.”
South Florida has an abundance of very secure communities with the cachet to attract high-profile buyers.
Indian Creek
, a private island in Biscayne Bay, is its own municipality, with its own police department. The village’s streets are private, and access to the island is granted only to residents and their guests.
With that kind of security, the island has attracted the likes of
Jeff Bezos
,
Tom Brady
, and
David Guetta
.
“There’s gated communities like La Gorce and Sunset Island, and there’s private communities where they can actually deny access,” said Nelson Gonzalez, an agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty. Because Indian Creek owns its streets, access can be denied to visitors, unlike other islands in Miami-Dade County, he said.
“Even Star Island, if you tell them you wanna drive around, they can’t stop you,” Gonzalez said.
“A neighborhood that has its own police force is definitely preferred,” said Jonathan Bigelman, an agent with One Sotheby’s International Realty, who noted many luxury buyers come with expensive collections of jewelry, wine and cars — assets that need protection as well as their families.
For those who don’t go the route of gated or heavily patrolled single-family home communities, luxury condos also offer extensive security and privacy protection.
“It’s a no-brainer that security is an amenity [in condos],” Bigelman said.
Assouline noted that security and privacy depend on the development. Smaller, less social buildings are better for the uber private buyer, and a
private restaurant
can make a big difference, she said.
Fisher Island
, a private island off Miami Beach, is among the most secure condo enclaves in South Florida. The island is accessible only by ferry, boat or helicopter.
“There’s one way on, one way off,” Gonzalez said. “Fisher Island is for sure very, very secure.”
Jill Eber, an agent with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty, has lived on Fisher Island since 2000 and said the constant land and marine patrols of the island are a huge benefit to living there.


“I think security is a major draw here. People feel very comfortable,” she said. Even the hotel on Fisher Island is invitation-only: Guests of the hotel must be sponsored by a resident.
Luxury buyers keep flocking to secure communities for the sense of safety and refuge, Koch said.
“It’s like being in a bubble,” he said. “They feel comfortable.”

Actress Sarah Paulson is looking to woo buyers to her 500-square-foot trailer in what has been called America’s most expensive mobile home park.
The “American Horror Story” and “Bird Box” actress cut the price of her home at 16 Paradise Cove Road in Malibu by about 10 percent to just under $1.8 million. She originally placed the property, which sits within the 271-unit Paradise Cove Mobile Home Park, on the market for $2 million in May.
Coldwell Banker Realty’s Ren Smith has the listing.
The mobile home park at 28128 Pacific Coast Highway became a hot spot for celebrities over the years with its proximity to the beach. Minnie Driver, Stevie Nicks, Betsy Johnson, Matthew McConaughey and Pamela Anderson are among the list of past and present high-profile residents.
Paulson’s one-bed, one-bath home comes furnished and includes a golf cart for travel to the beach.


The award-winning actress paid $860,000 for the home in 2021, according to listing sites. She then enlisted Jeff Spiegel of Heartwood Construction + Design, along with Amy Kehoe of home furnishings store Nickey Kehoe to help create the bespoke space of jewel-tone paint colors and wallpapers, pine floors, brass fixtures, sleeping loft and custom furniture.
Prices within the park vary, depending on trailer size.
A 5,588-square-foot home with three beds and two baths hit the market for $5.9 million last March. It sold in June 2023 for $5.6 million.
Another home in the park, totaling 847 square feet, was listed at just under $4 million in September 2022. The two-bed, one-bath home sold in August 2023 for $3.5 million.

Richard Saghian, the billionaire founder and CEO of Fashion Nova, paid $30 million for a waterfront spec home and non-waterfront house in Miami Beach,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Ami Shashoua, a fintech executive and spec home developer, sold the waterfront house at 5718 North Bay Road and the non-waterfront home across the street at 5725 North Bay Road to Saghian in an all-cash deal, sources told
TRD
.
The fashion company mogul plans to use the waterfront house as a vacation home, his broker confirmed to
TRD
. Saghian and his online fashion company are based in California. Saghian
recently paid $118 million
for a new Beverly Hills headquarters. He’s worth about $1.3 billion, according to Forbes.
Maurice Boschetti of Boschetti Realty Group represented the buyer. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway EWM Realty International represented the seller. The sale closed within about 10 days of Saghian making an offer, though Saghian had previously looked at the property.
Shashoua is buying a condo at Five Park in Miami Beach and will be investing in other properties, Gonzalez said.
Shashoua listed the waterfront property for $76.5 million in February 2023. It was on and off the market, most recently asking $34.9 million. Together with the non-waterfront home, the properties were asking just shy of $39 million.


Boschetti said his client was “looking for a prime location and the best view” in his search for a Miami Beach vacation home.
The 7,800-square-foot waterfront house has wide bay views with 75 feet of frontage overlooking the mainland. It has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a home theater, wine cellar, fish pond, gym, cabana, wet bar and home elevator. It includes a four-car garage, generator and a saltwater pool, according to the listing. It was built in 2022.


The 0.4-acre property previously sold in 2010 for $3.4 million. Shashoua also previously had it on the market for rent,
asking $350,000 a month
.
The non-waterfront home, asking $5.5 million, spans 3,167 square feet with four bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms and a two-car garage. It was fully renovated, and a new pool and spa were added, according to the listing. Shashoua paid $2.8 million for the 0.2-acre property in 2022 via an LLC, records show.
The deals, which closed late Tuesday, add to recent sales activity on North Bay Road. On Monday, David and Victoria Beckham closed
on their $72.3 million purchase
of the waterfront spec mansion at 4736 North Bay Road.
Saghian owns a handful of homes in Southern California, including  two homes in the Hollywood Hills, two Malibu beach houses and The One in Bel-Air. Saghian acquired the latter
at auction
for $141 million in 2022. It totals 105,000 square feet and is being renovated.

The first property is a lakeside condominium in Palm Beach, Florida, that is situated just three miles from Mar-a-Lago. The exact address is not given.

More legal and financial problems for Rudolph Giuliani.
The IRS has placed a lien on a lakeside condominium in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and former lawyer for Donald J. Trump,
the New York Times reported
.
The lien was filed due to Giuliani’s outstanding income tax debt of approximately $550,000. This property is situated just three miles from Mar-a-Lago, the private club and residence of former President Trump.
Giuliani and his ex-wife attempted to sell the condominium for $3.3 million in 2019 but were unsuccessful in finding a buyer. The existence of the IRS court filing came to light through a report by The Daily Mail. Giuliani’s adviser, Ted Goodman, stated that Giuliani has a formal agreement with the IRS to address his tax debt.
Giuliani faces multiple legal battles and mounting legal expenses related to his efforts to support Trump’s bid to remain in office after the 2020 election. Among his legal challenges is a racketeering charge in Georgia for his role in that endeavor, as well as a defamation case brought against him by two election workers in the state.
Giuliani’s financial struggles became public knowledge when
he listed his co-op at 45 East 66th Street for $6.5 million
, Business Insider
reported
. The listing popped up on the market towards the end of July and comes with a complicated history, especially in recent years.


Sotheby’s International Realty’s Serena Boardman has the
listing
.
Giuliani purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002. The unit had enormous entertainment potential and it has entertained everything from podcast recordings to federal law enforcement agents when It was raided in 2021 by the FBI during its probe into Giuliani’s activities in Ukraine.
A year after the purchase, Giuliani married Judith Nelson on the lawn of Gracie Mansion.
Giulian’s lawyer, Adam Katz, acknowledged that Giuliani was facing financial difficulties, and at one point in August, Giuliani owed nearly $3 million in legal fees.
Additionally, he is being sued by Robert J. Costello, a former associate, for unpaid legal fees, and he recently faced a lawsuit from Hunter Biden for his role in disseminating personal information about Mr. Biden.
Giuliani has reportedly sought financial assistance from Donald Trump, believing he is owed millions of dollars for his efforts to support Trump’s election campaign. In response to these requests, Trump hosted a high-priced fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey club to aid Giuliani and provide him with a financial lifeline.

A Beverly Hills Flats pad to the stars has made its way onto the market for the first time in more than 70 years.
The Gloria Vanderbilt estate — named after the late fashion designer and socialite who once leased the property — is listed at $16.5 million for the six-bed, five-bath home. It was last on the market 72 years ago, according to the listing.
The late film and TV actress Noreen Nash was the last buyer and had been its long-time owner, residing there with her husband Dr. Lee Siegel, whose client roster included many Hollywood stars.
The 1920s traditional home, located at 719 North Maple Drive and totaling 6,138 square feet, carries big Hollywood history. Aside from its A-list owners, it also counted Elvis, Warren Beatty, film producer Robert Evans and actor Ali MacGraw as guests. Author Henry Miller had his wedding on the property, which can accommodate as many as 400 people seated and 14 cars.
Compass’
Josh Flagg
holds the listing and described the home in a statement to
The Real Deal
as being on “the best block on one of the most coveted streets in the Flats.”


The residence sits on over half an acre and has a pool, a patio, a guest house and a library.
The listing is another notch for the
Beverly Hills’ Flats
neighborhood, which is known for its large, flat lot sizes. Activity there is healthy and then some, according to
Flagg
.
“The Flats are thriving,” he told
TRD
. “They’re like owning a Treasury bill. The value is always increasing. It’s the smartest investment through the good times and bad times.”
The most recent sale in the neighborhood is that of TV executive David Salzman, who sold his over 9,900-square-foot home at
702 North Sierra Drive
, for $17 million on Wednesday.
The seven-bed, 11-bath home was marketed by Carolwood Estates’ Drew Fenton, Coldwell Banker Realty’s Jade Mills and Compass’ Ari Afshar. West Shores Realty’s Sharon Chang represented the mystery buyer.

It’s been a rough year for Bronx-born diva Jennifer Lopez, but she did manage to get $23 million for her Manhattan penthouse at 21 East 26th Street, according to property records released Monday.
It’s a respectable number, given her $25 million asking price before the apartment overlooking Madison Square Park
went into contract
this spring. The buyer was an anonymous LLC from West Palm Beach, Florida.
The listing brokers for the condominium unit were Chris Pomeroy and Richard Orenstein of Brown Harris Stevens.
Lopez paid $20.1 million for the apartment, one of
four units
in the six-story, neo-Georgian building, in 2014. She
listed it
three years later for $27 million but found no takers at that price. The unit has been on and off the market, much like its now former owner, who has been married four times.


The posh row house, called
the Whitman
, was built in 1924.
Chelsea Clinton
is among its residents (she
paid $10.5 million
in 2013), and race car legend Jeff Gordon previously owned a unit.
J-Lo’s recently released autobiographical documentary “This is Me…Now” has been called “
bizarre
” and
cringeworthy
, and led to the cancellation of her summer tour. One New York Times critic even asked, “
Is she for real?
”
Rumors circulated earlier this summer that Lopez and her husband, actor Ben Affleck, were headed toward divorce, but their split hasn’t been confirmed.
But the couple has sold off some of their property. Earlier this month, Lopez and Affleck listed their 38,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles for
$68 million
. The couple bought the 12-bedroom estate at 2571 Wallingford Drive in Beverly Crest in a $61 million cash deal last May. Lopez also sold her mansion in Bel-Air last October for
$34 million
— $8.5 million less than the asking price. She bought the estate, which has its own pond and beach, seven years prior from actress Sela Ward and her husband, Howard Sherman, for $28 million.

Content:
Noah Assad, the 33-year-old owner of Bad Bunny’s record label, dropped $7.2 million on a One Thousand Museum condo in Miami.
Records show Assad bought unit 2401 at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard from Three Dolphins LLC, a Delaware entity managed by Terry and Katrina Garnett.
Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty had the listing, and Orlando Barros of Florida Realty of Miami brought the buyer.
Assad is CEO of Rimas Entertainment, the Puerto Rico-based record label he founded in 2014. Rimas specializes in Latin trap and reggaeton music. Its artists include Arcángel, Corina Smith and Amennazy, but its breakout star by far is Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny was Spotify’s most-streamed artist for three years running, from 2020 to 2022, until he was bumped to second place by Taylor Swift last year. In 2022, Bad Bunny set the world record for highest grossing tour in a calendar year, bringing in $435.4 million with his World’s Greatest Tour,
Hypebeast
reported. Swift dethroned him once again with her billion-dollar Eras Tour.
Bad Bunny credits his rapid ascendence to Assad, saying, “There’s no big Bad Bunny superstar without Noah,” when presenting Assad with Billboard’s Executive of the Year award in 2023.


The Garnetts were an early Silicon Valley power couple. Katrina Garnett founded the software company CrossWorlds in 1996, in part with funding from her husband’s venture capital firm at the time, Venrock Associates. After scandalizing Silicon Valley with a magazine ad in a black cocktail dress in 1998, Katrina Garnett sold CrossWorlds to IBM in 2001 for $129 million, according to published reports. Today, Terry Garnett heads HeyScottie.com and Inxeption.com, and Katrina Garnett leads Garnett Ventures and sits on the board of councilors for USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering, LinkedIn shows.
The couple bought the
One Thousand Museum
unit for $5.5 million in 2019, records show. Completed that year, it spans 4,600 square feet, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to property records. They listed it for $8 million in April, Redfin shows. Gonzalez said they had it rented to a tenant paying $45,000 a month in rent while it was on the market.
The late Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid designed the 62-story, 84-unit One Thousand Museum. A group consisting of Louis Birdman, Gilberto Bomeny, Kevin Venger, Gregg Covin and Todd Michael Glaser developed it, and the tower’s amenities include a pool, gym, theater and spa facilities.
The tower has attracted celebrity owners like Victoria and David Beckham,
Marc Anthony
and David Grutman. In 2022, tech mogul Moisey Uretsky
dropped $18.3 million
on a penthouse in the building, but Gonzalez said the tower had gone through a yearlong sales dry spell before reggaeton artist Nicky Jam sold his unit for
$7 million
last month. Gonzalez said a few other units in the tower are likely going into contract soon.
“[Interest is] coming from people who were probably looking at these new construction [developments] and didn’t want to wait,” Gonzalez said of the new deals expected. He noted that Assad had also looked at new construction, but was familiar with One Thousand Museum through a friend. “They just didn’t want to wait.”

The New York Mets’ shortstop is making a play for an Upper East Side pad.
Francisco Lindor signed a contract to purchase a penthouse at EJS Group’s at
200 East 75th Street
for roughly $20 million, sources familiar with the deal told the
Wall Street Journal
, which first reported the news.
The apartment, which last asked just under $23 million, spans 5,000 square feet and has six bedrooms, multiple terraces and 11-foot ceilings. The Journal did not include the unit number, but the outlet’s description matches a listing for PH5.
Sales at the building launched in March, with Compass’ new development marketing arm, led by
top broker Alexa Lambert
, Susan Wires and Marc Achilles, at the helm.
About half of its 36 units have found buyers. Construction at the 18-story condominium is expected to be completed next year. Its planned amenities include an outdoor fireplace, movie theater and virtual sports room.
“We decided to lean into New York City at a time when many others were leaning out,” EJS’ founder Ted Segal told the Journal. “It’s very gratifying to see how the market’s responding to the vision we had for the project.”
Segal declined to comment on the specifics of the deal.
EJS assembled the land for its development in 2021 for a combined $32 million. The building and its neighbor, a 33-story project by the Elad Group, are
enveloping a century-old walkup
, as the four-story apartment building holds on to its Third Avenue spot through a network of tenant protections and zoning rules.


The developer was funding the early stages of construction out of pocket until it scored roughly $112 million in financing from Bank OZK last year.
Lindor joined the Mets in 2021, after more than five years with the Cleveland Guardians, previously known as the Indians. He signed a 10-year contract worth $341 million, which at the time made him the
highest-paid player
in the team’s history.
The 31-year-old baseball star was eclipsed by a fellow New York star on Sunday when the franchise agreed to what ESPN billed as the “
largest deal
in professional sports history. “
The Mets, owned by billionaire Steve Cohen, signed outfielder Juan Soto to a 15-year, $765 million contract. The star, who’s joining from the New York Yankees off a World Series run, was reportedly offered a
$760 million contract
to stay with the Bronx Bombers.


Lindor, who was born in Puerto Rico, also has a home outside of Orlando, Florida, which he purchased for $2.9 million in 2021.
Lindor could not be reached by the publication for comment. He was represented in the deal by Douglas Elliman’s Dan Benichou.

Retired Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn has a new home in Miami Beach.
Vonn paid $10.5 million for the waterfront property at 3605 Flamingo Drive, sources told
The Real Deal
.
The 6,200-square-foot, six-bedroom, seven-bathroom house sits on a half-acre lot with about 100 feet of frontage along the Intracoastal Waterway.
Sharon Beck, a real estate agent with Luxuri International Real Estate, represented the seller, Jonathan Campau. Campau is founder of that brokerage firm, which is led locally by broker Larry Shinbaum. Beck declined to comment.
Bill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman’s Bill and Bryan Team represented the buyer. Hernandez declined to comment.


Vonn, an Olympic and World Cup champion Alpine ski racer, and her boyfriend, Diego Osorio, are looking to sell their waterfront
Normandy Shores
home at 970 South Shore Drive in Miami Beach, according to property records and the listing. It’s on the market with Hernandez and Sereny for $5.3 million. Vonn and Osorio paid $4.4 million for the 3,000-square-foot house last year. Osorio is an actor and founder of Lobos 1707 Tequila.


Campau, who used the Flamingo Drive property as a vacation home, sold it because he is focusing on expanding his firm in Aspen, according to a source. Campau paid
$10.2 million
for the house a year ago.
Beck
was also involved in that off-market sale.
Similar to other waterfront neighborhoods across South Florida, Flamingo Drive has experienced a jump in price appreciation over the past few years. This summer, top Miami Beach broker Oren Alexander and his brothers sold their waterfront Flamingo Drive mansion for
$27.5 million
.
In April, Related Group executive Steve Patterson sold his waterfront house at 2901 Flamingo Drive
for $14.8 million
. At the beginning of the year, spec developer Todd Glaser sold his longtime home at 3681 Flamingo Drive
for $11.8 million

LL Cool J has found a buyer for
his Encino contemporary home
in the Los Angeles neighborhood’s tony Royal Oaks community, according to the MLS and the buyer’s agent.
A mystery buyer paid $4.9 million for the property at 15641 Meadowgate Road earlier this month. The purchase price was a discount on the five-bed, six-bath home that originally hit the market in May for just under $6 million. The property was last listed at $5.2 million.
eXp Realty of Greater Los Angeles’ Jahi Johnson represented the buyer. The listing agents were Douglas Elliman’s Josh Altman and Coldwell Banker Realty’s Deborah Bremner.
Johnson declined to provide details about the buyer.
“Encino’s been affected like the broader market,” Johnson said of dealmaking in the neighborhood this year. “There’s been less transactions because of interest rates and there have been a lot of people sitting on the sidelines.”


The two-level residence, built in 2017, has vaulted ceilings, two living rooms and a chef’s kitchen, according to the Zillow listing. Outdoors, there’s a pool house, a pool and spa, and a BBQ.
The property sits on nearly half an acre within the Royal Oaks gated community, where several other celebrities have bought or sold homes over the years. That high-profile roster includes former professional baseball player
Jimmy Rollins
,
DJ Zedd
,
Michael B. Jordan
,
Kelly Clarkson
and
Joe Jonas
.
The neighborhood, along with other parts of the San Fernando Valley, is popular among those looking to pay less for more space. The median price of an Encino home sold in November was $1.2 million, down from just under $2 million a year ago, according to Realtor.com data.
Property records show LL Cool J, whose real name is James Smith, and his wife Simone Smith paid $4.3 million for the home in 2018.
The sale price allows the couple to avoid the city of Los Angeles’ Measure ULA tiered tax. Oftentimes referred to as the mansion tax, ULA applies a 4 percent tax on commercial or residential properties starting at $5.15 million and 5.5 percent on those sold for $10.3 million or more.

Former pro boxer Mike Tyson bought a lakefront spec mansion in Delray Beach for $13 million.
Tyson and his wife, Lakiha, signed a purchase agreement for the 12,286-square-foot, six-bedroom and nine-bathroom mansion on El Caballo Court in Delray Beach, property records show.
Jonathan Schneider of Boca Raton-based Wimbledon Real Estate represented the Tysons. A Delray Beach-based company led by Joseph Creamer developed the estate. Creamer, an agent with Abigail Wapner Realty, also listed the property with Thomas DiBucci of Kingdom Living Properties Co.
The 2.7-acre property was recently completed. It includes an 80-foot pool and spa, covered terrace, a bass pond with a waterfall, a gym, four-car garage and more, according to the listing. Creamer paid $1.5 million for the land in December 2021. The house hit the market before it was completed in 2023 for nearly $17 million.
Schneider said the Tyson family “has been a valued client and friend for many years.”


Tyson, known as “Iron Mike” and “the King of the Ring” is considered one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He briefly came out of retirement last year to fight Jake Paul.
Tyson owns a mansion outside of Las Vegas, in Henderson, Nevada. The Tysons also own a cottage on an air strip in Delray Beach that they acquired last year for about $1.7 million, records show.
The
Delray Beach
spec mansion is in western Palm Beach County, where a handful of high-priced estates have traded in the past couple of years. In December, a retired tech CEO paid $36.8 million for the waterfront mansion at 16161 Quiet Vista Circle in the Stone Creek Ranch gated community,
setting a record for Delray
.
That deal beat the previous price record set in 2023, when a company linked to
retail developer Cafaro Company paid $26 million
for a lakefront mansion in the same neighborhood.

The listing agents, Douglas Elliman’s Noble Black and Erica Grossman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


Frankel’s Bridgehampton compound is hitting the market nearly a year after she purchased a home facing Shinnecock Bay in Southampton for $5.5 million.
Behind the Hedges
first reported the sale in May after the 53-year-old TV personality and self-proclaimed chicken salad influencer revealed her new digs on Instagram.
Frankel spent the summer posting about her time Out East on social media, including from the kitchen, pool and private beach at her new Southampton home.
Frankel left Bravo’s RHONY in 2019, but her fame was reignited three years later when she started posting videos reviewing drugstore beauty products on TikTok and Instagram. Frankel, who has 3.5 million followers on Instagram,
told Business Insider
in February she made $3.2 million in endorsement deals with brands such as L’Oreal and Dunkin.


Frankel lives full-time in Greenwich, Connecticut, where she previously sold a five-bedroom home for $3.3 million — up from the $2.1 million she paid for it in 2020. That year, she also sold another of her Bridgehampton properties for
$2.3 million
, down from its $3 million asking price.
In 2016, Frankel tapped her fellow Bravo star, “Million Dollar Listing New York” mainstay Fredrik Eklund, to sell her condo in Tribeca, which was at the center of her contentious divorce from ex-husband Jason Hoppy. Eklund claimed the apartment sold for just under
$7 million
just one day after hitting the market.

Musician Jimmy Buffett’s easy-going music that exalted the Key West lifestyle led to him amassing a $1 billion net worth, according to Forbes.
And while his ascendency to wealth was atypical, his real estate holdings were a bit more conventional.
Buffett — who died Sept. 1 at 76 due to complications from a rare form of skin cancer — owned homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and another in Sag Harbor, New York. He also had an estate in St. Barts,
according to Barrons
.
Palm Beach, Florida
Buffett recorded some of the most iconic songs extolling the virtues of Key West, including “Margaritaville,” but Palm Beach was a part-time home for a long while.
The singer and business mogul, along with his wife, Janem sold their
home at 309 Garden Road for $6.9 million
to Warren B. and Allison Kanders, property records show.
The “Cheeseburger in Paradise” singer-songwriter put his house on the market in October for $7.6 million with Denise Hanley of Denise A. Hanley, Inc.
Buffett paid nearly $5 million for the three-bedroom, 4,783-square-foot home in 2011. The non-waterfront
Palm Beach
home, with a pool, was built in 2003.
It’s not the only home Buffett owned in Palm Beach. Buffett
also lived at 540 South Ocean Boulevard
, which, along with two other properties, was sold in 2014 by billionaire philanthropist Jon Stryker to companies tied to an English luxury home-building firm for $43 million.


Stryker purchased 540 South Ocean from Buffett and his wife Jane in 2010.
Sag Harbor, New York
Buffett owned a five-bedroom, six-bathroom, 5,300-square-foot home in Suffolk County, according to Trulia. It’s where he spent his final days, according to multiple sources.
Latitude Margaritaville Retirement Villages
These 55+ communities are inspired by Buffett’s music and lifestyle — namely food and escapism — in Florida. The cottages and homes start in the $300,000+ range,
according to the website
.
Margaritaville Hospitality
Buffett built much of his wealth on his business holdings, one of which was his Margaritaville hospitality company called Margaritaville Holdings LLC, which has
locations
in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean, including
in South Florida
. The hotel chain has dozens of locations nationwide.
In July it was announced that a
Margaritaville-branded hotel could anchor
a proposed waterfront mixed-use project in Riviera Beach’s Marina Village.
The project’s master developer, Atlanta-based APD Solutions, is partnering with singer-turned-hotelier
Jimmy Buffett
to add a five-story building with 150 rooms and an 875-space parking garage to anchor the proposed mixed-use site, which also entails 225,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space.
Vaughn Irons, APD’s CEO, unveiled his development team’s plan last month during a meeting of the Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency, which owns the sprawling 90-acre redevelopment site known as Marina Village. The partnership also includes Sonnenblick Development, based in Pacific Palisades, California.

A
Bird Streets
property once owned by Britney Spears and later Brittany Murphy is on the market for nearly $18 million in a bid to test a rebound of the tony Hollywood Hills neighborhood.
Beverly Hills-based
Carolwood Estates
’ David Parnes and James Harris of the Bond Street Partners team, along with San Jose brokerage Haylen Group’s Helen Chong and Susanna Leung, have the listing on 1895 Rising Glen Road.
It’s a winding drive through the hills to get to the estate sitting high above the Sunset Strip. The property received extensive renovations in 2016 and now looks nothing like its former self, when it was owned by the two celebrities.
Another $2.7 million was pumped into the home by the current seller, who Parnes declined to provide details on, with updates spanning the outdoor motor gate and front entrance steps, to bedroom built-ins and a new guest bedroom with a marble fireplace.
Property records show the home is owned by a Rhode Island-based trust.
Totaling 9,400 square feet, the three-floor home has five bedrooms and nine baths. It’s on a roughly 1.2-acre lot with a theater, separate wing for a fitness studio and massage room, elevator, floor-to-ceiling windows, wraparound terrace and two wet bars.
The property last traded in December 2020 for $12.2 million, according to listing sites.
Sales in the Bird Streets have moved in line with L.A.’s overall luxury home market. Interest rates, among other factors, hampered deals earlier in the year. Now, with more rate cuts expected, agents see some business coming back.
“Sentiment feels good right now and there’s momentum,” Parnes said on a recent weekday, while standing on the home’s balcony overlooking the city.


It could help that the Rising Glen home’s next-door neighbor may have reset the market.
The 23,000-square-foot mansion at
1898 Rising Glen Road
sold in April for $62.8 million, marking L.A. County’s priciest on-market deal this year.
An LLC called Starlight Capital bought the eight-bed, 18-bath home from spec developers Brandon and Deborah Shainfeld.
The buyers were represented by Haylen’s Chong and Leung, while Westside Estate Agency’s Kurt Rappaport and Andreas Elsenhans represented the sellers.
Other sellers in the vicinity have also sought to test buyer appetite for the neighborhood in recent months.
Within the Bird Streets, there’s 1380 Mockingbird Place, which was relisted earlier this month for just under $35 million. There’s also 1457 Blue Jay Way, which was relisted for nearly $20 million in May, after last being listed in September 2023.
Elsewhere in the Hollywood Hills, the home at 8116 Laurel View Drive, which sits above the famed Chateau Marmont, sold for $19 million last December and was placed on the market in September for nearly $24 million.
Spears bought the home in 2001 at the age of 19, paying a little less than $3 million. The “Toxic” singer sold the house to Murphy in 2003.

At least one legal battle over the estate of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein appears to be over.
Katherine Feinstein, Dianne’s daughter, is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit surrounding her mother’s Stinson Beach home after it sold for $9.1 million on Nov. 21,
the San Francisco Chronicle reported
.
The 3,565-square foot home at 325 Seadrift Road was initially listed for just under $8.5 million.
The property, owned by Dianne Feinstein and her late husband Richard Blum in a joint property trust, became the subject of a legal battle over the summer.
Following Blum’s death in February 2022, his share in the trust transferred to Michael Klein, a longstanding business associate. Katherine Feinstein, who held power of attorney for her mother, sought to sell the house amid Dianne Feinstein’s rising medical expenses.


Katherine Feinstein claimed over the summer that
holding on to the home is “unproductive and cannot be made productive without significant expenditure
,” and that the best thing to do is to sell the property.
However, legal disputes emerged, with Klein’s lawyers accusing Katherine of hastening the sale for personal gain.
The legal battle persisted after Dianne Feinstein’s death in late September, leading to a San Francisco Superior Court judge initiating mediation in November instead of an immediate sale order.
Katherine Feinstein’s request to dismiss the lawsuit was filed on Dec. 4, less than two weeks after the property sale.
The home, described as one of Marin County’s most exclusive, features floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Bolinas Lagoon.
The Sherfey Group represented the seller, while Compass represented the buyer.

Tech CEO Jody Glidden, the boyfriend of Lisa Hochstein of “The Real Housewives of Miami” fame, sold his waterfront Miami Beach home to his next-door neighbor.
Glidden sold the 3,629-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom home at 240 South Hibiscus Drive for $11.9 million to the recent owner of the waterfront house next door at 250 South
Hibiscus Drive
, property records show.
A trust hiding the true buyer’s identity purchased both Hibiscus Island homes, spending a total of $25 million on the houses, which sit on almost half an acre of land combined.
Compass agent Eli Faitelson with the Carroll Group had listed Glidden’s house for nearly $14 million. It’s also on the market for rent, asking $105,000 a month with Eva Garzon Gonzalez of Grand Lion Real Estate Group, according to the listing.


Gildden paid $4.2 million for the home in 2019, which means he sold it for more than twice his purchase price. It was built in 1938.
Glidden founded the software companies Introhive and Postilize.
Glidden is dating Hochstein, who last year
moved into a luxury condo
at One Ocean in Miami Beach, developed by the Related Group. Hochstein signed a multi-year lease for $32,000 a month.
Glidden “really stepped up and helped contribute” to Hochstein’s lease because her soon-to-be-ex-husband Lenny Hochstein wouldn’t contribute more than the $17,000 a month, a source told
The Real Deal l
ast year. Hochstein moved out of the Star Island mansion she previously shared with Lenny, a well-known plastic surgeon.
Last month, a waterfront Hibiscus Island mansion traded
for $31.9 million
, marking one of the most expensive home sales on Palm and Hibiscus islands, which are connected. In May, Chilean developer and casino mogul Claudio Fischer sold a spec mansion on Palm Island for
$40 million

The actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore is listing her Sagaponack estate at 16 Old Barn Lane in the Hamptons for $8.5 million, the New York Post
reported
. She reportedly
bought the place
in 2019 for $5.5 million before embarking on a remodel.
The home dates back to 1920, though it’s been redesigned several times since then. There’s seven bedrooms and six bathrooms between the main house and a small guest cottage. Several of the bedrooms are ensuite and some have adjoining decks and balconies.
The main home spans 6,850 square feet, with the price breaking down to nearly $1,241 per square foot. There’s built-in bookcases, a brick fireplace and French doors leading out to the grounds.
The grounds resemble much of the luxury outdoors space seen across the East End. The home includes a pool, pool house, bocce ball court and multiple lounging areas, and is within a mile of the ocean.
Sotheby’s International Realty’s Kathy Konzet has the listing.


Barrymore is best known for her roles in movies such as “E.T.,” “The Wedding Singer” and “50  First Dates,” as well as the Netflix series “Santa Clarita Diet.” Since 2020, she’s been hosting her own talk show on CBS, though she brushed up against controversy when she tried to bring it back to air amid the Writers Guild of America strike, leading to a very public apology.
More homes
hit the market
in the Hamptons and the North Fork in April than during the same month last year, according to Miller Samuel’s report for Douglas Elliman.
In the Hamptons, new listings rose 41 percent annually, up from 92 to 130, while new signed contracts remained steady between the two periods.

Soccer superstar Neymar is the latest player to put down roots in South Florida.
The Brazilian footballer, whose name is Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, paid $26 million for a waterfront residential plot in Bal Harbour, where he plans to build a home, sources confirmed to
The Real Deal.
The
Wall Street Journal
first reported the purchase.
Property records show a company led by
Bent Philipson
sold the 0.6-acre lot at 148 Bal Bay Drive. Philipson, a controversial investor in elder care facilities, founded the nursing home consulting firm called Philosophy Care. He and his wife paid $9.3 million for the property in 2020, which at the time included a home. The house has since been demolished.
Neymar plays for the Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and Brazil’s national team. Saudi journalist Tariq Al Nofal reported that Neymar’s contract with Al Hilal
will be sold to Inter Miami
.
The Bal Harbour property has about 150 feet of water frontage, according to the listing. It was on the market with Douglas Elliman agents Ruthie and Ethan Assouline of the Assouline Team for $28.5 million. The sale closed last week, according to the buyer’s agent, Bento Queiroz of Compass. Queiroz declined to comment on the buyer’s identity. The Assoulines also declined to comment.


The property, in a guard-gated community, comes with approved plans for a 13,000-square-foot mansion, according to the listing. Queiroz said his client was looking for a waterfront, oversized lot in a private neighborhood.
Recent sales in Bal Harbour include David Arison’s
$23 million purchase
of a waterfront home.
If he joins Inter Miami, Neymar will be playing with his former Barcelona teammates, Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Suárez. In March, Suárez
paid $11.5 million
for a  waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale’s gated Bay Colony neighborhood, near Messi. Messi bought his Bay Colony home in September of last year for
$10.8 million
.


Even Inter Miami’s owners have been buying and selling homes as of late. David Beckham, a co-owner of the MLS franchise, and his wife Victoria Beckham recently
paid $72 million
for a waterfront spec mansion on North Bay Road in Miami Beach.
Beckham and his Inter Miami partners, led by MasTec Chairman Jorge Mas, plan to develop a major
mixed-use soccer complex
on the former Melreese golf course site near Miami International Airport. Inter Miami currently plays at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale.

Retired basketball star Jason Richardson bought a flipped mansion in Miami.
Richardson dropped $6.3 million on the 1.2-acre estate at 10010 Southwest 60th Street from Jeff Aririguzo, a source confirmed. Aririguzo is an e-commerce entrepreneur and influencer.
Jorge Uribe of One Sotheby’s International Realty had the listing, and Gisele Bonetti and Megan Clark of Coldwell Banker brought the buyer.
Richardson had a 14-season career with the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors, Charlotte Bobcats, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers between 2001 and 2015. He was the fifth overall pick in the NBA draft in 2001.
Reports emerged earlier this summer that Richardson’s sons, Jase and Jaxon Richardson, up-and-coming high school basketball stars, were transferring to Columbus High School in Miami. The Richardsons would be joining the twin sons of former
NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer
on the team, according to
SBLive Sports
. Jase Richardson, a senior this year, has received offers to play at Stanford University, University of Southern California, University of Alabama, and his father’s alma mater, Michigan State University.


Aririguzo bought the estate in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, just south of Olympia Heights, for $3.8 million last September, records show. Built last year, the 8,800-square-foot mansion includes five bedrooms, five bathrooms and one half-bathroom, according to property records. The 1.2-acre estate also has a gym, a pool and an outdoor kitchen. The listing also noted there are 14-foot ceilings throughout the home.
Aririguzo listed the mansion for $6.3 million in July, Redfin shows. The sale marks a 68 percent increase in price in one year.
With the move to South Florida, Richardson joins a crowd of basketball pros who own luxury real estate in the region.
In October, LeBron James bought a condo at Estates at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach for
$9 million
. Also last year, Miami Heat All-Star Jimmy Butler bought a South Miami home for
$7.4 million

Fox News host Bret Baier is upsizing in Palm Beach, dropping $37 million on a house in an off-market deal.
Records show Baier bought the house at 125 Wells Road from Roberta Weiner.
Dana and Paulette Koch of the Corcoran Group represented the seller, and Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate represented the buyer, Dana Koch confirmed.
Bret Baier is a Fox News star and host of “The Special Report with Bret Baier.” In March of last year, he and his wife, Amy Baier, bought a flipped home from designer and real estate investor Tommy Hilfiger for
$12 million
. They listed it for $16.5 million in June, Realtor.com shows. Angle is the listing agent.
Weiner is the wife of Boston-based developer Stephen Weiner. As the head of Weiner Ventures, he developed the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Boston, and has a portfolio there consisting of the Boston Park Plaza and the Verb Hotel, the firm’s website shows. Weiner is currently wrapped up in a years-long legal battle over a failed condo development, according to the
Boston Globe
. In January, a judge ruled that Weiner and his son knowingly destroyed evidence related to the case, the outlet reported.


The couple sold a condo on North Breakers Row in Palm Beach for
$12 million
in 2015.
Roberta Weiner’s 125 Wells Road Land Trust bought the 0.6-acre home on Wells Road for $11 million in 2013, records show. Built in 1992, the 6,700-square-foot house was extensively renovated in 2015. It has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and one half-bathroom, Realtor.com shows. The property also includes a pool.
Baier isn’t the only conservative media player with Palm Beach property. Sean Hannity, the host of “Hannity” on Fox News, bought a townhouse on the island for
$5.3 million
in 2021. The Palm Beach Town Council
approved his plans
for an addition to the townhouse in November.
Roger Ailes, the founder of Fox News who was later ousted from his leadership following allegations of sexual misconduct, bought a Palm Beach home for
$36 million
in 2016. He died in Palm Beach the following year.
Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh also amassed an oceanfront compound on Palm Beach. After he died in 2021, his widow, Kathryn Adams Limbaugh, sold the 2.3-acre estate to cosmetics heir William Lauder for
$155 million
in March.

Billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel won approval for the design of a new house he plans to build on Miami Beach’s Venetian Islands.
Miami Beach’s Design Review Board approved the project at a meeting in February, giving Thiel the OK to build anew on part of his waterfront estate. The tech mogul is splitting up his compound, demolishing one of the houses and replacing it with a modern 6,800-square-foot home, planning documents show. Thiel bought the homes at 441 and 445 East Rivo Alto Drive for
$18 million
in 2020 from
former Ford CEO Jacques Nasser
. Since then, Thiel has hosted a number of parties and fundraising bashes for GOP politicians, according to published reports.
Thiel
and his co-founders sold
PayPal
to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002 and went on to launch the venture capital firm Founders Fund and data analytics giant Palantir Technologies. He was famously Facebook’s first investor, and has advocated for young adults to forgo college and launch companies with his Thiel Fellowship. He has an estimated net worth of $7.2 billion, according to Forbes.


The aging Venetian Islands compound includes two houses, two pools and 0.6 waterfront acres. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1947, and the 5,500-square-foot house at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1956, according to property records. His approved plans show he intends to split the properties and build a new house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive. The plans do not note his intentions for the adjacent home at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive.
The timing for the construction project is convenient. Thiel, a well-known libertarian who backed Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has declined to fund any politicians in the 2024 race –– so no need for fundraising events.
Thiel’s new house will include two offices, a guest bedroom and bathroom, nanny’s quarters with a service entrance and three bedrooms fronting a playroom, the plans show. He and husband Matt Danzeisen share two daughters, according to published reports.
The house, designed by Leo Marmol and Rod Radziner’s Los Angeles-based firm Marmol Radziner, will also have a redesigned pool and landscaping.
Since Thiel bought his compound in 2020, the Venetian Islands have become a South Florida hub for the so-called “PayPal Mafia” and other Silicon Valley giants. Venture capitalist and PayPal alum Keith Rabois, an early bidder on LinkedIn, Square and Yelp, bought a Venetian Islands mansion
for $28.9 million
in 2020. Famed WhatsApp investor Jim Goetz bought a pair of adjacent homes
for $29.6 million
in 2017 and 2019.
This month, the
$22.5 million sale
of a Venetian Islands house was linked to “PayPal Mafia” member and venture capitalist David Sacks.

The Jumpman hung in the air with his real estate offering for over a decade, only to end up making a crash landing.
After nearly
13 years on the market
, retired Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan’s massive Highland Park mansion has finally sold for $9.5 million, significantly below its last asking price of $14.855 million.
The 56,000-square-foot home at 2700 Point Lane went through a series of price cuts over the years, becoming
a symbol of the difficulty sellers of ultra-luxury
Chicago-area real estate have had recouping their investments into properties.
Jordan’s sale echoes the trend of high-end homeowners taking significant losses this year, including the $15.25 million sale of an estate in Lincoln Park previously listed at $50 million.
The buyer of Jordan’s former home, doesn’t appear to have been represented by a real estate agent, and remains unknown. Jordan’s agent, Katherine Malkin of Compass, declined to comment to Crain’s, which
reported
earlier Wednesday evening the sale had been finalized.


Jordan, a retired NBA Hall of Famer and billionaire, held onto the asking price — the digits of which added up to his jersey number 23 — for over nine years, despite multiple price cuts previously.
The 8.4-acre estate, built in 1995, boasts 15 full bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a regulation-sized basketball court and a circular infinity pool. However, the Lake County Assessor values the property at $4.94 million, which means the Jordan property’s tax bill could double.
Jordan purchased the property for his then-wife Juanita Vanoy and their first children in the early 1990s. After their divorce in 2006, he maintained ownership and put the mansion on the market six years later, at first asking $29 million. Despite its luxurious features and unique tie to the legendary hooper, the property failed to attract a buyer at its initial price.
He cut the asking price twice in 2013 first to $21 million then $16 million, and even tried to hold an auction for it with a $13 million reserve price that year without making a deal, according to the
Chicago Tribune
. Jordan had held the $14.855 million ask since 2015.
The sale is the fourth highest-priced home sale of the year in the Chicago area and highest-priced sale ever in Highland Park for a property not on Lake Michigan. Lakefront homes in Highland Park have sold for higher prices, but none have come with the chance to boast of owning Jordan’s former home.
It remains unclear whether the house has been vacant or unused during its lengthy time on the market. Jordan reportedly owns multiple properties across the country, including homes in Florida, North Carolina, and Utah.

Subhead: Michael Gronager of Chainalysis paid $11M for duplex at 67 Franklin Street

A Tribeca penthouse featured in “Owning Manhattan” finally found a buyer — and it appears to be the co-founder of a New York-based cryptocurrency company.
An LLC tied to Michael Gronager, former CEO of Chainalysis, paid $11 million for the duplex at 67 Franklin Street, according to property records. The purchase came with a $5 million mortgage.
Gronager, who abruptly stepped back from his post late last year, previously signed another public document on behalf of the purchasing entity, Cool and Perfect LLC. The company was used to buy a condo at 111 West 17th Street in Chelsea for $3.3 million in 2018.
The 3,800-square-foot home is finally trading more than a decade after sales launched at the landmarked building known as Cast Iron House. The
New York Post
first reported news of the signed contract earlier this month but didn’t include the identity of the buyer.
The four-bedroom penthouse last asked $12 million, down from just under $13 million when it hit the market with Ryan Serhant’s eponymous firm in 2021, according to Streeteasy. The apartment was the last remaining sponsor unit at the building, developed by Knightsbridge Properties.
The home — and its 1,500-square-foot wraparound terrace — was featured in the
reality TV show
following agents at Serhant’s eponymous firm, which premiered on Netflix in June. In an episode of the show, Jordan Hurt, one of the listing brokers and cast members, described the penthouse as a “Malibu Beach house in the middle of Manhattan.”
Krista Nickols, also with Serhant, represented the listing with Hurt and the firm’s founder. The listing agents did not respond to requests for comments.


A spokesperson for Gronager’s firm did not respond to a request for comment.
The mortgage document lists a Miami Beach address that once belonged to the CEO of Related Group’s multifamily division. Steve Patterson, and his wife Carly, sold the waterfront mansion at 2901 Flamingo Drive to an anonymous LLC called Flamingnet for
$14.8 million
in 2023. It’s now  under contract with a last asking price just under $18 million, according to Zillow.
The five-bedroom home is down the street from a lot owned by disgraced broker, Tal Alexander. The former co-founder of Official Partners paid $3.1 million for 2687 Flamingo Drive in 2020.
Sources told
TRD
that Alexander family patriarch, spec home developer Shlomy Alexander, is
quietly shopping the property
, along with others owned by members of the family, while Tal and his two brothers, Oren and Alon, await their trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
Gronager co-founded Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, 10 years ago, alongside Jan Møller and Jonathan Levin. The company tracks cryptocurrency transactions and “has been used to solve some of the world’s most high-profile criminal cases.”
Gronager took a
sudden leave of absence
from the firm in October in a move the company described only as “temporary.” His departure came a year after Chainalysis laid off 15 percent of its staff.

A former chief executive of Burger King who once
cleaned toilets
at the fast-food chain probably won’t be doing that at his new home — a prestigious penthouse steps from Central Park.
Daniel Schwartz, who ran the burger giant from 2010 to 2019, paid $17.2 million for a pad at 993 Fifth Avenue, according to public records. Schwartz’ wife, Rachel, was also listed on the deed. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Schwartz called
The Real Deal
’s report of the sale “inaccurate,” but declined to elaborate.
Schwartz bought the apartment from real estate industry veteran David Feinberg, whose company Feinberg Properties bought, sold, rented and appraised real estate, according to
Bloomberg
.
The co-op duplex, which is more than 5,000 square feet, was listed at $20 million when it went into contract in December. It had been priced as high as $39.5 million, in 2021, according to
StreetEasy
.
The four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom unit features a private elevator which leads to a grand marble foyer entrance, wrought-iron staircase and walk-in coat closet. The home has a 53-foot-wide terrace overlooking Central Park, and 12 rooms, including a 39-foot-deep salon and library, both with fireplaces.
Serhant’s Ryan Serhant had the listing.
The 17-story, 19-unit limestone building has housed many of Manhattan’s elite and their children. The daughter of Goldman Sachs’ former head of merchant banking bought an apartment for roughly
$25 million
in 2020, and the son of Chanel chairman Alain Wertheimer snagged one for
$19 million
in 2019.


Feinberg himself seems to have followed in the footsteps of his father Peter, who
founded
a real-estate investment and development company in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is across the street from the Emory Roth-designed building, also had an
apartment in the co-op
for its executives.
The penthouse purchase is apt for Schwartz, who shot to the top of the business world as an industry wunderkind. Schwartz joined investment firm 3G Capital in 2005 and made partner in 2008. The firm acquired Burger King for $4 billion in 2010 and appointed Schwartz as CFO; three years later, he was named CEO at the age of 32.
Under Schwartz’ reign, Burger King became Restaurant Brands, which doubled its valuation from 2016 to 2019.  Schwartz stepped back from the chief executive role in 2019. He remains on the board at Restaurant Brands and is a co-managing partner at 3G, according to
LinkedIn
.
While leading Restaurant Brands, Schwartz was based out of Miami and Toronto, but told
Forbes
he planned to spend more time in 3G’s New York office.
The penthouse deal adds to a slew of top-floor purchases. In the past two weeks, penthouses have accounted for a quarter of Manhattan luxury contracts, according to
Olshan Realty’s weekly report
.

Consumer goods multimillionaire Anand Khubani paid $100 million for an assemblage on La Gorce Island in Miami Beach,
The Real Deal
has learned. It marks the most expensive residential sale in Miami-Dade County this year.
An undisclosed buyer is purchasing a smaller piece of the seller’s holdings for $22 million, for a total sale price of $122 million, said Danny Hertzberg, one of the listing agents. That deal is expected to close soon, he said.
Khubani, founder and CEO of Wayne, New Jersey-based consumer brands company Ideavillage, bought the properties at 18, 22 and 24 La Gorce Circle, sources told
The Real Deal
. The undisclosed buyer is acquiring the property at 16 La Gorce Circle.
Khubani’s purchase marks the most expensive residential deal to close since hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin purchased Adrienne Arsht’s former waterfront Miami estate for
$106.9 million in 2022
.
The La Gorce Island assemblage
went into contract
in early April, sources said. It
hit the market
two years ago for $170 million.
Danny and Jill Hertzberg and Jill Eber of The Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker represented the seller, the trust of the late Dr. M. Lee Pearce.
Brett Harris of Douglas Elliman and Zach and Cody Vichinsky of Bespoke represented Khubani.
Harris said the buyer is in the design phase to build a home for his family.
“He’s very happy with the location and the view and it’s a legacy lot,” Harris said. “He looked here for almost a decade. The reduction in price made the land attractive.”


Danny Hertzberg called it a “major milestone” that Miami “has now had two $100 million sales… Pre-pandemic, $47 million was the record for years,” he said.
“Ultra-high net worth people continue moving here,” he added.
In April, Khubani sold a vacant oceanfront lot in Palm Beach
for $85 million
in an off-market deal. His firm, Ideavillage, owns consumer goods brands Copper Fit and Microtouch, and he also invests in and acquires consumer brands through Ideavillage, according to Ideavillage’s website.
Pearce, a controversial activist investor and a medical doctor, paid more than $3.1 million in the 1980s to assemble the properties, which total nearly 3 acres with about 600 feet of water frontage.
Khubani likely plans to redevelop the properties.
The house at 18 La Gorce Circle has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a guest house. The two-story house at 22 La Gorce Circle has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and five half-bathrooms. The property at 24 La Gorce Circle is a park.
The two-story home at 16 La Gorce Circle has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. That lot was split off from the other three this summer.
The houses were built beginning in 1936, and each home has its own dock.
In June, spec developer Philippe Harari’s AquaBlue Group sold the waterfront spec mansion at 98 La Gorce Circle
for $62.5 million
. Jill Eber of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty brought the buyer.

After spearheading a remarkable post-pandemic turnaround, it appears as if the Brooks Brothers CEO has treated himself to a new pad.
One Grand 16s, a limited liability corporation tied to Ken Ohashi, paid $9.45 million, or roughly $2,700 per square foot, for a penthouse condo unit at 1 Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.
The 3,500-square-foot apartment went into contract in May after spending a little less than a month on the market,
The Real Deal
previously
reported
.
The apartment has four beds and three baths, as well as 2,500 square feet of outdoor space, including a roof terrace. The unit also has a 60-foot living and dining room, renovated kitchen and floor-to-ceiling windows. It previously sold for $5.1 million in 2012.
Compass’ Libby Ryan, along with the Ryan + Ryan and The Leonard Steinberg teams had the listing.
The 15-story, 99-unit building designed by Richard Meier has a full-service staff, bike storage and parking. The all-glass building, which was developed by SDS Procida in 2005 and put on the market in 2008, was initially considered a failure, with the
New York Times
calling it “a wall of windows into the real estate bust” in 2009.
The property sold its first penthouse in 2011 for $3.97 million and by late summer 2012, the condominium building had
sold out
. Documentarian Ken Burns
bought a three-bedroom unit
for $2.75 million in 2014.


The penthouse home is just blocks away from Ohashi’s current residence at 168 St. Marks Avenue, located between Vanderbilt Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. Ohashi and his husband Adam Freed purchased the townhouse in 2015 for $4 million. The seven-bed, four-bath home is not currently on the market.
Ohashi’s latest purchase comes after a whirlwind couple of years at the helm of the beleaguered fashion retailer, which sold to mall giant Simon Property Group and apparel licensing firm, Authentic Brands Group for $325 million in August 2020 after declaring bankruptcy. The company suffered from the pandemic-induced remote working culture, which slowed foot traffic and devalued retail brands that emphasized business casual attire.
Ohashi took the helm of Brooks Brothers in 2020, months after the fashion brand filed for bankruptcy.
Nearly four years later, Ohashi appears to have led the company back into its pre-pandemic,
billion-dollar sales echelon
. Ohashi told
Axios
last year that aggressive markdowns of underperforming lines and a pivot into sportswear were keys to the company’s recovery.
Ohashi’s neighborhood of choice, Prospect Heights, is also on the rise. The area has seen several large rental buildings shoot up in the past couple years, and its median sales price in June was up 22.4 percent year-over-year, according to
Redfin
.

NBA superstar Shaquille O’Neal is selling one of his homes in Dallas-Fort Worth.
Shaq has listed his 5,270-square-foot Carrollton estate at 4012 Sahara Court Carrollton, for just under $1.7 million, the Dallas Morning News
reported
. The price is under $322 per square foot. Zac Gideo of Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate has the listing.
O’Neal purchased the home, located in Gates of Prestonwood, for $1.22 million in 2022. Built in 2005, it features five bedrooms, high-end kitchen appliances, a library with a fireplace, an open-concept living space with views of the lagoon-style pool, walk-in attic spaces and a six-seat media room.
The move to sell his Carrollton estate comes after O’Neal’s recent
purchase
of a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. The sale price wasn’t disclosed in the property records, but the Rockwall Central Appraisal District shows the home’s appraised value is $1.7 million.
While O’Neal primarily used his Carrollton home as a part-time residence, the location of his Rockwall County home will likely play a key role in helping him expand his chain of O’Neal’s Big Chicken restaurants throughout the region.


O’Neal’s Carrollton home is being marketed by Gideo, who was also the buyer’s agent for O’Neal’s home in Health, purchased in April through O’Neal’s the Chexy Trust.


The Dallas-Fort Worth luxury market is having a strong year so far, according to the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&amp;M University. Sales of homes priced $1 million or more were up 28 percent in May, compared to the previous year, with about 500 sales.
“Year-to-date sales of all homes in the Dallas-Plano-Irving metro division are up 2.15 percent compared to last year,” Texas Real Estate Research Center analysts wrote. “However, after taking out the million-dollar listings, the remaining home sales were flat at 0 percent over the same period.”

Billionaire Sue Gross, ex-wife of billionaire bond king Bill Gross, is looking to offload another Beverly Hills manse.
Gross is asking $35 million for her four-bed, five-bath home at 984 North Alpine Drive.
She has enlisted Carolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton to list the home.
The founder of the Sue J. Gross Foundation charity wasn’t in the home for very long, moving in back in 2022 after construction was completed on the property.
She paid $20 million for the home in 2018 and then began a multi-year renovation.
The 6,569-square-foot house sits behind gates on a more than half-acre lot. It has a motor court, 12-foot ceilings, a dining room enveloped in glass, service kitchen, separate staff parking and high-tech security system.


In 2022, Gross sold her home at 960 North Alpine Drive, about a two-minute walk from her current listing, for $23.3 million. The four-bed, seven-bath home originally hit the market with a $38 million ask. Gross purchased the property in 2017 for $35 million in an off-market deal from Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi.
Gross still has a sizable real estate portfolio, which includes homes in Palm Desert and the Laguna Beach private community of Irvine Cove.
Forbes estimates Gross’ net worth at about $1.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of that is estimated to have come from her divorce from Bill Gross, co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Company, known as PIMCO. The two divorced in 2017 after more than 30 years of marriage.
The 984 Alpine Drive home, if sold, would be among Beverly Hills’ priciest deals so far this year.
The top trade in the city in 2024 is the $37.1 million sale of 1006 North Roxbury Drive in June. The Richard Landry-designed home has five beds and 10 baths. Earlier in the year, in February, a nine-bed, 14-bath home at 1000 Laurel Way sold for $30.1 million. That same month a five-bed, eight-bath home at 514 Doheny Road traded for $31.9 million.

The billionaire co-founder of WhatsApp has been shopping for an ultra-luxury waterfront estate in South Florida,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Ukranian-American businessman and computer programmer Jan Koum has toured a handful of properties in recent months, including
Tom Brady
’s waterfront estate in Indian Creek, as well as a waterfront mansion on Bal Bay Drive in
Bal Harbour
, sources told
TRD
. Both are in gated communities.
Brady has been entertaining offers for his property at 26 Indian Creek Island Road. The retired quarterback and businessman was reportedly close to selling the mansion for a price ranging from $150 million to $175 million.
Koum and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton sold WhatsApp, a popular communications app, to Facebook’s parent company, Menlo Park, California-based Meta, in 2014 for $19.3 billion. Koum is now worth nearly $17 billion, according to Forbes.


Sales activity in the ultra high-end coastal market in Miami-Dade County, including Miami Beach and Bal Harbour, has increased since the
presidential election
. Brokers say the limited inventory of turnkey homes is keeping prices high.
So far this year, at least three major deals have set or will set neighborhood records once they close. Todd Glaser and his partners are
in contract to pay $105 million
for Sonny and Suzanne Kahn’s waterfront home in Miami Beach, a deal that will mark a record for North Bay Road. Glaser is hoping to either flip the property or build a spec mansion that could hit the market for $250 million.
In Altos del Mar, a gated neighborhood in North Beach, the CEO of Sedano’s Supermarkets sold his oceanfront home
for a record $35.6 million
in an off-market deal.
And earlier this year, developer Fatos Rosenberg sold a waterfront estate and the house across the street for $92.1 million. The
$85.2 million sale
of the larger property marked a record for Miami’s Bay Point neighborhood.

Content:
If you’re a Mickey Mantle fan — and who isn’t? — there’s a chance to own a piece of the iconic baseball player’s history without breaking the bank.
Rally, a company known for offering fractional ownership in collectibles, has unveiled plans to sell shares of Mantle’s boyhood home in Commerce, Oklahoma, for $7 — The Mick wore No. 7 during his Hall of Fame career for the New York Yankees — each,
ESPN reported
.
Shares go on sale this Friday.
With the move, Rally, which bought the two-bedroom bungalow in 2022 for $175,000 and currently values it at $329,000, is attempting to to blend the worlds of sports memorabilia and real estate investment.
Rally’s co-founder and chief product officer, Rob Petrozzo, said he hopes the property would attract hordes of visitors, like Graceland or sites associated with Motown.
While Rally plans to retain a small percentage of ownership in the house, the responsibility for determining the property’s direction will lie with shareholders. Still, the company is reserving the right to sell the property if it deems it beneficial for investors, ESPN said, citing Rally’s regulatory filing.


Details over things like property taxes, property maintenance, insurance and other potential cost-sharing issues for investors were not available, but Petruzzo said Rally would likely, or at least could, cover such things for up to five years.
While Rally may be confident that it can rally buyers, there’s plenty of Midwestern skepticism in Commerce, where some residents remain unconvinced about the valuation of the property, suggesting that a similar home might typically sell for around $10,000.
Others in the town, including former mayor Michael Hart, are cautiously curious, having observed the constant stream of Mantle enthusiasts visiting the house daily, eager to be a part of the baseball legend’s history.
Amid the buzz around Mantle’s childhood abode, some experts caution that fractional ownership, while providing a chance for participation in coveted assets, may not yield substantial financial gains, especially given the fluctuations seen in the trading of sports memorabilia.
Nonetheless, the appeal of Mantle’s legacy in the world of baseball and collectibles persists, highlighted by the record-breaking $12.6 million sale of his 1952 Topps card in 2022.
Mantle famously played 18 years for the Yankees, amassing 536 home runs, three MVP awards and seven World Series titles, en route to a 110.2 career wins above replacement.

Will the City of Los Angeles designate Marilyn Monroe’s former home in Brentwood a landmark, staving off the wrecking ball? Its owners and the public won’t know for weeks.
The L.A. City Council has put off a vote on whether to name the house where the star of “Some Like It Hot” died at 12305 5th Helena Drive a historic cultural monument, setting the vote for June 26,
the Los Angeles Daily News reported.
Councilwoman Traci Park, who represents the area, had introduced a motion in September to preserve the home when its owners sought to bulldoze it to expand their home next door.
Last month, Brinah Milstein Bank and her husband, reality TV producer Roy Bank,
sued the city
for their alleged right to demolish the Spanish hacienda-style home. On June 4, a judge tentatively denied their attempt.
“Following the recent court decision and pending litigation, as well as ongoing discussions between the City Attorney’s Office and the property owners, I would like to continue the item … for good cause,” said Park, who had requested the postponement.
The Banks bought the first and last home owned by the Hollywood siren in July for
$8.35 million.
They bought the house next door, a 6,000-square-foot dwelling at 12306 6th Helena Drive, in 2016 for $8.2 million.
But their plans to raze the 2,900-square-foot Monroe home to make room to expand their house next door created an international outcry — and an order by the city to temporarily stave off the wrecking ball.
Days after
reports surfaced
that the century-old home faced demolition, the L.A. City Council in September rushed through a motion to consider
designating the property a historic cultural monument
, a move that would invalidate the demolition permits.


In January, the city’s Cultural Heritage Commission approved the application to designate the home as a historic cultural monument. The council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee shortly followed suit.
In a written statement to
The Real Deal
last month, Milstein and Bank’s attorney Peter Sheridan alleged the city had “engaged in an illegal and unconstitutional conspiracy” involving government officials and tour operators and violated the law “with regards to the quasi-judicial process required for evaluation of alleged historic cultural monuments.”
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Chalfant issued a tentative ruling in favor of the city, calling the Milstein-Bank motion an “ill-disguised motion to win so that they can demolish the home and eliminate the historic cultural monument issue.”
The couple would not suffer the irreparable harm they claim by being denied a preliminary injunction because the City Council will address the issue, according to Chalfant.
Monroe bought the one-story, four-bedroom home in early 1962 for $77,500 — or roughly $790,000 in 2023 dollars — after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller. Less than six months later, the 36-year-old actress was found dead from a drug overdose in her bedroom.
The house’s front step tiles read “Cursum Perficio” — Latin for “my journey ends here.”

For some, Kanye West’s former house in Malibu looks like a bunker on the beach after the rapper stripped the cement structure of finishes, plumbing and electrical wires.
But Belwood Investments owner Steven “Bo” Belmont — whose firm finagled a steal, paying $21 million for 24844 Malibu Road — sees only upside: the sand and beach are still steps away and the foundation remains of the Tadao Ando-designed home.
Now, it’s just a matter of restoring the 4,000-square-foot house with help from Marmol Radziner, a design firm involved with the home’s original construction in 2013 for financier Richard Sachs.
Malibu Road, bought at a 60 percent discount from its January listing price, represents Belwood’s largest single-family residential project to date. It’s also the buzziest by virtue of the home’s former owner and the treatment of the property by West, who now calls himself Ye. (See accompanying photo slideshow from a walk-through of the property.)
The high-profile transaction also brings to light the unusual business model Belwood uses to grow its investment portfolio. At its simplest, the company is a real estate flipper using a fractionalized investing model on its mostly residential and some commercial fix-up projects.
Where it gets interesting is the app platform Belwood uses to pool investors. These investors typically account for 20 percent of a property’s acquisition financing. Belwood comes in with the remaining 80 percent, working with its stable of lenders. In the case of Malibu, it arranged financing with CV3 Financial Services, an El Segundo-based provider of bridge, rental and construction loans. Homes are rehabbed or restored and then resold, with the profit split between Belwood and the investors.
With Ye’s former home, a total of 500 investors hopped on board to loan anywhere from $1,000 to $1 million.
It’s technically not crowdfunding, Belmont explained, with individual investors acting as private lenders on a property. In return, those individuals are trustees until the real estate is sold.
The investors, to a certain extent, are part of the decision-making process on property work. Currently, they can leave comments about a project through the app. A new version expected to soon launch will add voting capabilities on certain finishes, such as painting the walls White Sand versus, say, White Linen, Belmont explained.
“It’s still a white wall, but it gives them the opportunity to help decide,” he said. “It’s the same with the concrete, same for the roof and same for the front door.”
In the case of Malibu, Belwood Investments expects to shell out $6 million to $8 million on an estimated 12- to 16-month renovation project.
What works
Malibu is the latest of Belwood’s expanding Los Angeles market buys.
The firm’s local under-construction portfolio includes the late singer-songwriter Bill Withers’ home at 1614 Viewmont Drive in the Hollywood Hills, plus two other Viewmont Drive properties. There are also homes at 1925 and 1855 Loma Vista Drive in Beverly Hills. Belwood also has  2201 Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills and 7610 Woodrow Wilson Drive near Laurel Canyon.
Belmont said he isn’t set on one price point over another: “I buy properties that are $30 million. I buy properties that are $30,000.”


Coastal California, Florida and New York are all markets Belmont considers sustainable domestically.
“I don’t go to Wyoming. I don’t follow the shiny objects. That’s not my thing because those [markets] are the most heavily impacted when the market shifts,” he noted.
While ensuring a property has good foundational elements that can lead to a quick sale, Belwood also looks for homes that are rentable as a safety net in the event of a market turn.
The strategy has largely remained intact since Belwood’s start.
Belmont, who originally began as a mortgage broker in the early 2000s, saw his mentors successfully flip homes during the subprime mortgage meltdown. He bought his first property in Antelope, north of Sacramento at 3052 Scotland Drive for $175,000. He handled all the work to educate himself on the process and pricing. He sold it for $350,000 three months later.
He flipped another two homes on his own before friends took note. They liked the idea of flipping but didn’t want to do it full-time or put their retirement savings on the line. Belmont offered to handle half the purchase price, while his friends came up with the other half and they split the profits.
That process later opened up beyond Belmont’s friends in what officially became Belwood, utilizing the app to keep investors informed of projects’ progress.
“I designed it to be the anti-BlackRock or the anti-Blackstone,” Belmont said. “This was designed to create a financial impact not only to the local investor but to the community.”
Eyeing DTLA office
The company, which has corporate offices in Folsom, more recently opened a Newport Beach location and is now working on an Athens, Greece outpost.
The overseas strategy eyes properties in tourist areas as short-term rentals. The goal, unlike domestically, isn’t to venture into suburban areas, Belmont said.
Farther out, the 80/20 split in funding acquisitions is likely to shift. Belmont projected the firm will eventually move to cover 90 percent of a deal.
In the commercial space, Belwood expects next week to complete work on a golf course, set to be called Belmont Pines Golf Course north of Santa Rosa. There’s also an RV park and a Calistoga motel.
Belmont said flex space that can lead to conversions, or a mix of uses, are the focus near term.
He acknowledged the more he delves into commercial, the greater the complexities are in working with state and local governments. Still, he said he’s sitting on the sidelines, eyeing Downtown Los Angeles’ challenged office market in particular.
“I’ve had my eyes on the big, tall buildings with the graffiti all over them,” Belmont said without naming Oceanwide Plaza. “I would love to take that on. That’s kind of a lofty goal.”

Sean Hannity may be done with New York, but fans of the Fox News host are not, likely to the delight of the media personality.
Hannity sold his home on Long Island’s Gold Coast for approximately $12.7 million, the Wall Street Journal
reported
. The sale of the home at 406 Centre Island Road in Oyster Bay closed only weeks after the estate hit the market for roughly $13.8 million. The purchase price works out to approximately $1,155 per square foot for the 11,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom main home.
While the anonymous buyer — a fan of Hannity — came in more than $1 million under the asking price, they also snapped up Hannity’s furniture and books, which brought the total price of the transaction above $13 million. The buyer also offered a cash deal and terms favorable to the seller.
The six-acre estate includes a private dock on Oyster Bay, a par 3 golf course and a putting green, along with a swimming pool and a lighted tennis court. Hannity purchased the property in 2008 for $8.5 million and spent millions on renovations over the years.


Nest Seekers International’s Shawn Elliott and Zachary Elliott had the
listing
. The home received four offers, leading to a bidding war, and went into contract within a week of its listing.


At the start of the year, Hannity announced the move of his “Hannity” program and “The Sean Hannity Show” radio program to West Palm Beach, declaring himself done with New York and ready to embrace the “free state of Florida.”
Hannity bought an oceanfront townhouse in Palm Beach in April 2021 for
$5.3 million
. The 3,800-square-foot, three-bedroom, four-bathroom townhouse has a back patio, which includes a private pool, facing the ocean. A year after the purchase, the Palm Beach Town Council unanimously approved plans for
an addition
for the home.

Philadelphia 76ers star and reigning NBA MVP Joel Embiid is trusting the real estate process.
The big man listed his his top-floor penthouse condo for $5.5 million, or $1,571 per square foot, the Philly Voice
reported
. Embiid purchased the for 11th-floor unit at 101 Walnut Street in the city’s Society Hill neighborhood for $3.2 million in 2018.
The luxury two-bedroom unit spans 3,500 square feet, with two full bedrooms, two half baths and two balconies on the main level. The unit also has private rooftop space with a pool, a hot tub and an outdoor kitchen.
Building amenities include a virtual doorman and private elevators for the property’s suites. The monthly homeowners association fee comes out to $3,828, according to
Realtor.com
.
Serhant’s Andrea Desy Edrei and Jennifer Rhee
have the listing.


The two agents were previously part of some local residential brokerage drama. Their former firm, Philadelphia’s Keller Williams Black Label,
accused Ryan Serhant’s eponymous firm
and the brokers of a scheme to “loot” the company for the New York-based brokerage’s expansion into the Keystone State.
The 29-year-old Embiid was drafted by the Sixers in 2014. He has cemented himself as a key operator for the team, poised to claim the NBA’s award for Most Valuable Player award for the second straight season.
Embiid’s former teammate and fellow 76ers star Ben Simmons listed
his Philadelphia-area home
in Moorestown, New Jersey, in 2021 for $5 million, two years after purchasing the place for $2.3 million. A buyer ultimately closed on the home
for $4.5 million
in April 2022.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos paid $87 million for his third waterfront estate in the Miami area, bringing his total spent in the exclusive Indian Creek Village to $234 million.
Bezos acquired the 10,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom mansion at 28 Indian Creek Island Road nearly a week ago on May 29 under the Sunshine Trust, records show. His pending purchase was
previously reported
in April.
Bezos, the third richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of more than $197 billion, closed on the home less than a year after he acquired two waterfront adjacent properties he plans to redevelop into a larger estate also on Indian Creek island.
The guard-gated island is home to celebrities such as Tom Brady, singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias and
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner
. Only residents and invited guests are allowed on the island. Last month, a waterfront Indian Creek home traded for
$64.5 million
in an off-market deal.


Bezos’ third acquisition is a nearly 2-acre property that includes  a pool and dock. The house was built in 1956 and expanded in 1986 and 2014, property records show.
Former banker Javier Holtz sold the home. He paid $2.5 million for the property in 1998.
Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, were looking for a move-in ready mansion while he has a new estate built on the nearby properties at 11 and 12 Indian Creek Island Road.
In October, Bezos
paid $79 million
for the nearly 2-acre estate at 12 Indian Creek in a deal brokered by Dina Goldentayer and Danilo Tavares of Douglas Elliman. In June 2023, Bezos
paid $68 million
for the adjacent mansion in a sale that was brokered by Sohely van Woerkom of Golden Ocean Real Estate, led by Gabriela Espejo.
The Amazon founder has roots in South Florida: he graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1982. Two years ago, his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, purchased
two waterfront homes
in Coral Gables for $78 million.

Never mind the glamorous addresses and eye-watering prices. If there’s one takeaway from Los Angeles’ most expensive residential deals, it’s that 2024 was the year of Carolwood Estates.
The Beverly Hills boutique brokerage — started in late 2022 by Hilton &amp; Hyland alumni Drew Fenton and Ed Leyson, along with Nick Segal — participated in half of this year’s top 10 deals.
Elsewhere in the market, and not surprisingly, Westside Estate Agency’s Kurt Rappaport turned up in 2024’s priciest transactions, including the No. 1 deal that set a new state record in May.
Here are L.A. County’s top residential deals, compiled by
The Real Deal
Research using
TRD
reporting, L.A. County Assessor records, Redfin, Homes.com and Compass.
1. 33064 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu | Unknown | $210 million
A Malibu estate once owned by Oakley founder Jim Jannard was catapulted to record-breaking status when it sold in May for $210 million.
The off-market deal, which created a new high for the state’s residential sales, was brokered by Westside Estate Agency’s Kurt Rappaport.
Jannard, whose wealth comes from the founding of eyewear brand Oakley and then camera company Red Digital Cinema, sold his 15,400-square-foot manse on 9.5 acres to an unknown buyer shielded behind a Delaware-registered LLC.
The eight-bed, 14-bath home was previously owned by Oaktree Capital billionaire Harold Marks, who sold the property to Jannard in 2012 for $75 million.
2. 28106 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu | Laurene Powell Jobs | $94 million
The $94 million buy of 28106 Pacific Coast Highway was Malibu pad number four for Laurene Powell Jobs.
The widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs picked up the 1950s ranch-style home in a June off-market transaction that adds to three other compounds she owns right next to her latest acquisition. The unknown seller was a trust, according to property records.
Spanning 6,400 square feet, the home has eight beds and six baths sitting on a lot with more than 4 acres.
3. 312 North Faring Road, Los Angeles | Lapro Property | $65 million
Nick Molnar, co-founder of buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay, plunked down $65 million for a Holmby Hills manse named after comedian Fanny Brice.
Property records show Lapro Property bought the nearly 19,000-square-foot home. That entity was linked to Molnar after it sold a Century City penthouse in 2023 to Rihanna for $21 million.
The “Funny Girl” Estate was purchased from British singer Robbie Williams in an off-market deal. Williams moved into the property in 2022, after paying $49.5 million.
Carolwood Estates’ James Harris and David Parnes represented both sides in the deal.
The Georgian-style house, designed by architect Oscar Shamamian counts seven beds and 11 baths. It’s double gated with a spiral staircase anchoring the two-story entry, wine cellar, butler’s pantry, tennis court, koi pond, gardens and fitness center.
4. 1898 Rising Glen Road, West Hollywood | Starlight Capital | $63 million
When developers Brandon and Deborah Shainfeld sold their 23,000-square-foot spec home in April, they ended up hitting the reset button on pricing in West Hollywood’s Bird Streets neighborhood. The $62.8 million deal, at the time, was L.A. County’s priciest before the summer’s mega Malibu deals.
A limited liability company named Starlight Capital bought the gated home, which sits on about 1.5 acres. The property includes a two-story entrance, cold plunge, infinity pool, outdoor kitchen and pickleball court.
Westside Estate Agency’s Kurt Rappaport and Andreas Elsenhans held the listing, while Haylen’s Helen Chong and Susanna Leung represented the buyer.
5. 24186 Case Court, Malibu | Malibu Case | $61 million
The spec mansion sitting on a bluff overlooking Malibu Colony Beach became the city’s largest residential deal in 2024 when it closed in July.
The home with  more than 10,500 square feet, named The Edge, was the first to sell in Unvarnished developer Scott Gillen’s The Case community. Gillen’s ultra-exclusive residential tract includes homes between 9,500 square feet and 12,000 square feet.
Property records show the buyer was a Chandler, Ariz.-based limited liability company called Malibu Case.


Carolwood Estates’ Cooper Mount was the buyer’s agent, while The Agency’s Sandro Dazzan, Paul Lester, Daniel Stevenson and Aileen Comora had the listing.
The Edge has five beds and eight baths. Highlights include 13-foot ceilings, a 75-foot infinity pool, a 10,000-square-foot wraparound deck, a 500-square-foot terrace for the primary suite and an 800-bottle wine room.
6. 51 Beverly Park Way, Los Angeles | 51 Beverly Park Way | $44 million
The celebrity-heavy gated community of Beverly Park logged its most expensive deal of the year in October, with a $44 million trade.
The property at 51 Beverly Park Way in North Beverly Park was sold by Larry Cohen and his wife Paulette Cohen, according to property records. Compass’ Sally Forster Jones listed the property on behalf of the couple.
Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California’s Aaron Kirman was the buyer’s agent, which property records indicate is a Delaware-registered LLC called 51 Beverly Park Way with ties to a Miami address.
The French Chateau sits on nearly 2 acres and boasts antique French chandeliers, seven fireplaces, marble and travertine floors, a billiard room, theater, tennis court and vineyard, according to the listing.
7. 320 Saint Pierre Road, Los Angeles | 320 SPR | $39 million
Old Bel-Air’s priciest home sale of the year came with its own vineyard.
Located in the East Gate part of Bel-Air, known for its large lot sizes, the 1920s home traded for $39 million. It sits on nearly an acre with an addition designed by architect Paul Williams and features eight beds and 11 baths. There’s a 1,800-square-foot guest home, separate movie theater, two laundry rooms, screening room and a 600-square-foot attic balcony, according to the listing notes.
Carolwood Estates’ James Harris and Maria Hellmund represented the seller, which property records show as a Miami limited liability company. Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California’s Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe represented the buyer, which records list as a Los Angeles-based LLC.
8. 33740 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu | Andrew Schwartzberg | $38 million
Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu hosted plenty of 2024 action. The $38.5 million sale of the Cape Cod-style home at 33740 Pacific Coast Highway kicked off the pricier activity of the year on this famed stretch of road.
Investors Mark Cirlin and Man Li-Yeh paid $10.7 million for the property in 2007 before selling it in March. Property records show the buyer was Andrew Schwartzberg, managing partner of Washington, D.C. affordable housing developer and investment firm Pennant Housing Group.
Chris Cortazzo of Compass along with Engel &amp; Voelkers’ Nicole Van Parys and Gary Nese had the listing for the sellers. Newmark Residential’s Steven Schaefer and Compass’ Gabrielle Sharron represented the buyer.
The two-story home has six beds and eight baths, with a detached one-bed, one-bath guest house. The big selling points: ocean views and beach rights to the cove below where the home sits.
9. 1006 North Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills | Fred and Susan Kunik Trust | $37 million
A check-cashing executive made the move into a Beverly Hills mansion designed by the king of megamansions, Richard Landry, in June.
The buyers were Fred and Susan Kunik. Fred is CEO of Santa Ana-based Continental Currency Services.
The five-bed, 10-bath home, which property records show was sold by the Alipour Family Heritage Trust, was originally listed for $45 million in 2021.
The buyer’s agent was Carolwood Estates’ Drew Fenton, while the seller was represented by Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California’s Aaron Kirman, Kirby Gillon and Bryce Lowe.
The more than 20,000-square-foot residence has five beds and 10 baths. Amenities include a 400-bottle wine room, staff suite, video room, a garage that fits more than a dozen cars, 54-foot pool and fountains.
10. Copa de Oro Road, Los Angeles | H. Roger Wang and Vivine Wang | $36M
A Bel-Air mansion traded from one billionaire to another in a $36.4 million deal that rounded out 2024’s priciest purchases.
An entity with ties to AfterPay co-founder Nick Molnar sold the six-bed, eight-bath home to H. Roger Wang and his wife Vivine Wang, according to property records. Wang helms China-based mall and office developer Golden Eagle International.
Carolwood Estates double-ended the deal. The brokerage’s James Harris and David Parnes represented the seller, while Linda May represented the buyer.
The home with more than 10,600 square feet has a two-story foyer, theater, gardens, pilates studio and security room.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos, the third richest person in the world, reportedly paid $68 million to purchase a waterfront home in Miami’s Indian Creek Village.
The Amazon founder is behind the entity that purchased the teardown at
11 Indian Creek Island Road
,
Bloomberg
reported, and one source who was not involved in the deal confirmed to
The Real Deal
. The sale closed on June 27.
Bezos and his fiancée, former news anchor and pilot Lauren Sánchez, had been looking for a new or renovated mansion in the Miami area, sources told
TRD
. His house hunting likely coincided with his visit to Miami in May for the Formula One Grand Prix. He may also be planning to purchase other properties, as he has looked at homes on Miami Beach’s La Gorce Island, Star Island and North Bay Road.
The mansion Bezos reportedly purchased was built in 1965 and expanded in 1985. It spans nearly 9,300 square feet with three bedrooms and three bathrooms on a 2.8-acre lot.
Former hotelier Tulia Soucy de Gonzalez Gorrondona, through a Nevis-based entity, sold the property to the Palm Trust, managed by Terri Lacy. Sohely van Woerkom of Golden Ocean Real Estate, led by Gabriela Espejo, represented the seller in the off-market deal, according to a copy of the closing statement obtained by
TRD
.


Bezos will be among other billionaires on Indian Creek, a guard-gated island north of Miami Beach, including Carl Icahn and hedge funder Eddie Lampert. Other homeowners include Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, singer and songwriter Julio Iglesias, and car dealership mogul Norman Braman.


DJ and producer David Guetta is also
in contract
to buy the waterfront spec estate at 37 Indian Creek Island Drive that’s asking $69 million, sources told

. Developer Todd Michael Glaser and his partners are selling the home to Guetta.
Bezos, whose net worth exceeds $160 billion, according to Forbes, also owns The Washington Post and the aerospace company Blue Origin. He has ties to South Florida and has spent more time in Miami recently. Bezos graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1982.
Last year, his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, purchased two waterfront homes in Coral Gables for $78 million. Attorney Anthony Lopez and his wife, Dr. Nicole Martin, who is on “The Real Housewives of Miami,”
sold their estate
at 9501 Journeys End Lane for $44 million. Former PetsMD Raquel Cordon and Raul Calvoz sold their adjacent home at 9475 Journeys End Road for

With their marriage apparently headed toward the rocks, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have decided to formally list their 38,000-square-foot mansion in Beverly Crest for $68 million.
The estranged A-list couple, who bought the estate a year ago after touring 80 properties, have put the 5.2-acre compound at 2571 Wallingford Drive on the market,
Mansion Global reported
.
After three failed attempts to buy a mansion, J.Lo and Affleck bought the fully furnished property in gated Wallingford Estates last May for
$60.85 million
cash.
Lopez and Affleck have spent the past year “warming up” its white-washed interiors, according to the Journal. There’s now a green-painted dining room, hardwood floors and carpeting over cold, polished-stone floors.
“They thought they could sell it off-market but made a game-time decision in order to put more eyes on the property,” an unidentified source
told US Weekly
. “They are in a rush to sell it. Ben especially wants to be done with the house. He was never happy there.”
Broker Santiago Arana of The Agency has the listing.
The mansion has 12 bedrooms and 24 bathrooms. There’s also a 5,000-square-foot guesthouse, a caretaker house and a two-bedroom guardhouse.
The estate includes basketball and pickleball courts, a gym, a boxing ring, plus a sports lounge and bar in what is billed as a “one-of-a-kind indoor sports complex.”
It’s also a car collector’s and party host’s dream, with a 12-car garage — plus parking for 80 more vehicles.


The two-story white mansion, built on a promontory, overlooks what may be
the biggest zero-edge pool in town
, at 155 feet long.
The French-style Wallingford Estate,
built in 2000
, was modeled on Le Petit Trianon, Marie Antoinette’s private château,
according to Forbes
. It has a 5,300-square-foot master suite, plus a cinema, wine room and a whisky lounge. It also has a spa with a hair and nail salon, sauna, massage room and stylist area.
It was purchased by developer Gala Asher in November 2016 for $22 million, then revamped.
Its prior owner, healthcare entrepreneur Jeoung Lee, bought the home after its previous owner, Curtis Somoza,
was caught in a $64 million Ponzi scheme
, for which he was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.
Affleck has already moved out of the Beverly Hills Post Office estate and rents a smaller mansion in Brentwood for $100,000 a month — just two blocks from the home of his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner,
the Daily Mail said.
Lopez lives separately at an unknown location, according to US Weekly. “Nothing has been decided yet as far as the divorce, but selling the house is the first step,” the insider said.
Affleck and Garner share three children together: Violet, 18; Fin, 15; and Samuel, 12. Lopez shares twins Max and Emme, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony.
The couple, who got married in 2022 after reuniting some 20 years after they called off their engagement in the early 2000s, purchased the megamansion after a months-long house hunt,
The Wall Street Journal reported
at the time.

Sales of more than $5 million are subject to a 4 percent transfer tax for sellers under Los Angeles’ Measure ULA, which equates to $40,500 in this deal.
Rollins, nicknamed “J-Roll” in his playing days, first placed the property on the market in 2022, listing it for $11.8 million. He paid $8.7 million for the luxe pad in 2018, when it was new.


The Valley Meadow property has a seven-bedroom main house, in addition to a guest home with a total of 10,419 square feet. The compound sits on about half an acre, set behind hedges.
Designed with gatherings in mind, a roughly 3,000-square-foot rooftop lounge offers a bar, entertainment system and views of the San Fernando Valley.
Rollins made his Major League Baseball debut in 2000 for the Philadelphia Phillies. He stayed on with the team for 14 years, with a 2008 World Series win over the Tampa Bay Rays among his career highlights. Rollins later played on the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2015 season.


He won the Most Valuable Player award for the National League in 2007.
Elsewhere in Encino’s Royal Oaks, rapper LL Cool J is asking for
nearly $6 million
on his 15641 Meadowgate Road home.
The property spans 6,000 square feet with four bedrooms, a heated spa and a pool house. Coldwell Banker Realty’s Deborah Bremner has the listing.

Miami Gardens native Rick Ross, a.k.a. Ricky Rozay, dropped $35 million to acquire the waterfront Star Island estate he was in contract to purchase.
The Grammy-nominated rapper and record executive closed on the 12,400-square-foot mansion at 37 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach, according to the listing agents. Ross posted about the purchase on social media after he was
approved by the Star Island homeowners association
in mid-July.
His neighbor on the island, Sean “Diddy” Combs, gifted Ross a golf cart, according to a post on Instagram.
The nearly 1-acre property was on the market for $37.5 million with a group of agents led by Coldwell Banker’s Jill Eber and Jill Hertzberg, of The Jills Zeder Group. Kimberly Knausz with One Sotheby’s International Realty represented Ross.
Property records show longtime Oracle executive Yale Brown, now managing partner of Columbus Ventures, sold the home. Brown paid $4.6 million for the estate in 1999.


It has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and one-half bathroom.
Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, founded the record label Maybach Music Group in 2009. He grew up in the Carol City neighborhood of Miami Gardens and attended Miami Carol City Senior High School.
His Star Island home, built in 1992, features a large covered terrace, pool, summer kitchen and a Japanese Zen garden. The property has 100 feet of water frontage on Biscayne Bay and a 40-foot dock.
Star Island
, with about 30 homes, experienced turnover over the past three years as the luxury market boomed shortly after the pandemic began.
New owners include billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin, who began acquiring Star Island land in 2020. Last fall, he sold the lot at 14 Star Island Drive to former baseball star turned real estate investor Alex Rodriguez. The deed was recorded at $18.5 million, about $5.5 million less than Griffin had paid.
In October, Lennar Corporation Executive Chairman Stuart Miller
secured city approval
for the waterfront mega mansion planned for his 2.8-acre assemblage at 4, 5 and 6 Star Island Drive. The modern compound would span 120,000 square feet, including outdoor space, featuring upper and lower level lagoons, a conference center/home office, a gym pavilion with a spa and massage room, a master suite with a terrace and plunge pool, a koi pond, and tropical landscaping, including gardens and a green roofscape.
Two years ago, billionaire Anthony Hsieh, founder and ousted executive chairman of LoanDepot,
paid $30 million
for the waterfront mansion at 34 Star Island Drive.
The waterfront Star Island estate owned by plastic surgeon Lenny Hochstein, also known as the “Boob God,” has been featured on “The Real Housewives of Miami.” Hochstein’s soon-to-be ex-wife, Lisa Hochstein, is a cast member on the show and has continued to live at the property after Lenny Hochstein first announced their divorce.

Inter Miami star Luis Suárez dropped $11.5 million on a waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale’s gated Bay Colony neighborhood, near teammate Lionel Messi.
Records show Suárez and his wife, Sofia Balbi, bought the house at 10 Compass Point from Bret and Jamie Macy in an off-market deal. Bret Macy is a platform general manager with Lithia &amp; Driveway, a publicly traded car dealership network based in Medford, Oregon, his LinkedIn shows.
Veroushka Volkert of One Sotheby’s International Realty represented both the buyers and the sellers. She declined to comment on the deal.
Suárez is widely considered one of the greatest strikers of his generation. The Uruguayan launched his professional career almost 20 years ago with Club Nacional de Football in Montevideo. He played with
Messi
at FC Barcelona from 2014 to 2020, and is rejoining his old teammate after signing a contract with Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami in late December, according to published reports.


The teammates will also be neighbors in Fort Lauderdale. Messi bought a waterfront mansion at 91 Compass Lane in Bay Colony for
$10.8 million
in September, following months of swirling rumors over where the soccer star would settle with his family. In an unexpected twist, Messi, Suárez and other Inter Miami stars have focused their purchases in two lesser-known gated communities,
Bay Colony
and
Sea Ranch Lakes
. Both have
24-hour security
and close proximity to the prestigious Pine Crest School.
Bret and Jamie Macy bought the Compass Point house for $3.6 million in 2020, records show. The couple completed an extensive renovation of the home, according to property records. Built in 1980 on 0.6 acres, the nearly 7,100-square-foot house has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, records show. The home spans 425 feet of waterfront, according to a previous listing.
Property records show the couple regularly invests in Broward County real estate. They bought a Fort Lauderdale condo for $365,000 in 2019, and a house in Coral Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale for $7.3 million earlier this month, records show.
Other recent Fort Lauderdale deals include
Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Antonio Neri’s $9 million sale
of a waterfront house to a logistics chief. Neri had bought the house for $8.5 million in 2021.

El Presidente has a new palace from which to rule.
Dave Portnoy, the polarizing founder of Barstool Sports and pizza maven, recently bought a luxe Nantucket compound for a record-breaking $42 million,
the Wall Street Journal reported
.
This off-market sale is the highest not only in Nantucket, but the state of Massachusetts, where the
previous record was $38.1 million
, which was set just a few months ago. The deal included additional $2 million worth of furnishings and other items, the outlet reported
Shellie Dunlap of Lee Real Estate, represented the sellers, identified only as  known as the MAK Daddy Trust and MAK Shack Trust, while Peter Engen of Lee Real Estate, represented Portnoy.
The 1.2-acre property, located in the Monomoy area, sprawls along the Nantucket Harbor waterfront. The owners bought two parcels in 2016 for a combined $13.3 million and custom-built the compound following the demolition of two existing homes.
The property now has a main residence designed by Andrew Kotchen of Workshop/APD, with  four bedrooms and a primary suite with an indoor-outdoor shower and spectacular harbor views. The compound also includes a pool area and guest quarters, accessible via an underground tunnel.
Portnoy, who is from Massachusetts, has previously invested in Nantucket real estate, having bought a property for around $2 million. He recently reacquired Barstool for $550 million after selling it to Penn Entertainment. He’s also known for appearing in headlines nearly as much as his media company generates them. In 2021, he faced allegations of
sexual misconduct
from several women, which he denied.
He’s also been accused of making misogynistic, sexist and racist harassing comments, which he has passed off as jokes, according to
the Washington Post
.


At the same time, he’s developed several wildly popular brands, including Barstool and the “
One Bite Pizza Reviews
,” which he spun off into a festival that took place last weekend. He also has a rabid fanbase, known as Stoolies. His reviews can boost restaurant revenue up to 50 percent, the WaPo said, and a fund he created to support restaurants and small businesses during the pandemic raised millions of dollars.
He’s also fond of buying beach homes.
In 2022,
he bought a beach house in the Hamptons
for $9.75 million.
The home sits on nearly a full acre of land, and the property includes a pool and a view of the ocean.
Compass’ Matt Breitenbach and Greg Gould represented both the buyer and seller in the off-market deal. Both declined requests for comment from The Real Deal on the transaction.
In 2021, he bought a bayfront Miami home for $14 million, a record for the city’s Morningside neighborhood.
That home is about 6,100 square feet in size, built in 1939 on a 1-acre lot. It also includes a pool, as well as nine bedrooms and eight-and-a-half bathrooms.

A company led by Wozniacki and Lee
paid $18.7 million

Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer was the listing agent for the five-bedroom, five-bathroom condo. It hit the market in January for $42.5 million.


Donnie Pingaro, Side’s managing broker in Florida, represented the buyer, according to the Multiple Listing Service.

Wozniacki and Lee have bought and sold other condos on Fisher Island. The couple, who married in 2019, sold a unit in the same building in 2021 for
$16.3 million

Jackie Kennedy Onassis’ childhood summer home is once again under new ownership.
Lasata, the name for the East Hampton estate at 121 Further Lane, traded hands for $52 million, the Wall Street Journal
reported
. The property came on the market three months ago for $55 million.
The seller was movie and film producer David Zander, who
purchased the property
from fashion designer Reed Krakoff for $24 million in 2018. It’s unclear who bought the estate.
The seven-acre compound includes an eight-bedroom, 8,500-square-foot main house dating back to 1917, which brings the sale breakdown to $6,117 per square foot when only considering the house. There’s also a two-bedroom guest house, a caretaker’s cottage, a pool house and a three-car garage.
When Onassis was a child, the home belonged to her grandfather, according to a biography. She likely wouldn’t recognize much if she were alive to walk the halls today, however, as Zander brought in interior designer Pierre Yovanovitch to renovate.


The Corcoran Group’s Eileen O’Neill and Compass’ Ed Petrie shared the listing. Sotheby’s International Realty’s Frank Newbold represented the buyer.
Kennedy lived in many places during her life, which has led to a steady stream of former homes going on and off the market. In March, a property in Washington, D.C.’s Georgetown neighborhood — partially including a home where Kennedy lived after John F. Kennedy’s assassination — hit the market for
$26.5 million
.
The Hamptons housing market
came to life
in July, when activity nearly caught up to levels from the previous year. New listings remained stagnant, however, as inventory remains a challenge.
In the second quarter, the Hamptons’ luxury market — the top 10 percent of sales — was hit hard by historically low inventory and a record share of bidding wars, according to Miller Samuel’s quarterly report for Douglas Elliman.

The home of late TV journalist Barbara Walters has gone from the small screen to the silver screen.
Walters’ 11-room apartment at 944 Fifth Avenue has been bought by an entity tied to former Disney president Michael Ovitz and his partner, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon.
Michael S. Dreyer, as the trustee of the Zenpax Trust, closed on the co-op unit for $14.99 million on July 9, according to public records. Dreyer was listed as the chief financial officer of the Ovitz Family Foundation on its
most recent tax filing
, and was the president of Artists Management Group, a previous Ovitz-led venture, according to
Variety
.
Ovitz and Mellon, who have been
engaged since 2014
, have both been active in the market for the past several years.
In 2022, Ovitz listed his West Village condominium at 155 West 11th Street for $25 million less than six months after buying it for $22 million from rock star Jon Bon Jovi.
Ovitz, who co-founded Creative Artists Agency in 1975 and departed for Disney in 1995, also sold an apartment complex for
$58 million in 2023
, almost $8 million less than he paid for it in 2017.
Mellon sold her penthouse apartment for just over $19 million in 2023. In 2008, the
British fashion entrepreneur
, who founded her own eponymous footwear brand, bought the pad for $20 million. The condo unit had appeared sporadically on the market since being listed for $34 million in 2014.
Dreyer could not be reached for comment.
Walters lived in her Fifth Avenue co-op for 30 years until her death in December 2022. The home was
initially listed
by her estate for $19.75 million in April 2023.


The price was dropped to $17.8 million in September and the unit went into contract toward the start of November,
Crain’s reported
.
At the time of the listing, Alexa Lambert of Compass told the
Wall Street Journal
that the Upper East Side home had two bedrooms but could be easily converted to a four-bedroom. The main bedroom has views of Central Park, and the apartment has four bathrooms and two half bathrooms. It is serviced by a private elevator that opens to a main foyer and 42-foot living area and library.
Lambert declined to comment on any details of the sale.
Walters, as the first female anchor of a nighttime network news program, was a trailblazer in the television industry. She interviewed many of the most influential figures over six decades, including every sitting president and first lady from Richard and Pat Nixon to Barack and Michelle Obama.
In her memoir, Walters wrote about frequently hosting at her apartment, including having Monica Lewinsky over for dinner several times before she agreed to an interview about the Clinton sex scandal.
The 14-story cooperative building has had several other prominent New Yorkers walk its hallways, including the late Broadway performer Isabelle Stevenson and Robert Mnuchin, the art dealer and father of former Treasury secretary Steven Munchin.
Mnuchin sold his unit in 2022 to RFR Realty principal Michael Fuchs for
$18 million
after listing it for $25 million in
October 2021
.
The Manhattan market has been wobbly for the past several years, experiencing drops in median sale price in six of the past seven quarters. Things began to turn around
last quarter
as listing inventory increased for the first time in 15 months and sales grew 12.2 percent year-over-year.

Fashion entrepreneur Julie Wainwright found just the right fit in a buyer for her contemporary Trousdale Estates home,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Wainwright, founder and former CEO of luxury consignment company The RealReal, sold her home at 590 Haynes Avenue in Beverly Hills for $10.7 million to a mystery buyer.
The listing for the property and Wainwright’s agent, Josh Flagg of Compass, called the Steve Hermann-designed residence “hands down the best deal in Trousdale Estates.”
Keller Williams Realty’s Hang Zhang brokered the transaction on behalf of the buyer.
Compass declined to comment on the buyer, while Zhang could not be reached for comment Friday.


Wainwright, who stepped down from her RealReal CEO and chair duties in 2022, placed the home on the market in August for just under $12 million.
The fashion executive launched the luxury consignment marketplace in 2011, with The RealReal making waves for its digital approach to high-end reselling. The company entered brick-and-mortar in 2017 with a permanent store in New York that kickstarted its physical retail expansion. Two years later, The RealReal raised $300 million in an initial public offering.
The 4,500-square-foot Haynes Avenue home sits on over half an acre lot that’s gated for privacy. It counts five bedrooms and five-and-a-half baths. Inside is Terrazzo flooring and a private wing housing the primary suite. Outside amenities include a teakwood deck, infinity pool and views of Trousdale Estates.
Haynes Avenue marks another Trousdale transaction for Flagg in recent months.
The home is less than a mile from
1875 Carla Ridge
, the former home of singer Charlie Puth. Flagg bought the Mid-Century Modern in the fall, paying an undisclosed sum in an off-market deal, sources told
TRD
at the time.
Puth paid $9 million for the more than 4,400-square-foot home in 2017. He listed it last November for nearly $17 million before reducing the price, with the most recent ask before it went into contract at just under $11 million.

Content:
Zoom CEO and founder Eric Yuan is in a legal battle over an Atherton home that he agreed to buy from builder Ali Sadeghi for $37 million in early 2021 but never actually closed on,
The Real Deal
has learned.
The LLC he used to transact on 88 Tuscaloosa Avenue sued last August, claiming construction costs and timelines went far beyond initial estimates, and Sadeghi requested another $8.14 million to complete the project, according to court documents filed with California Superior Court.
The suit names Sadeghi and his affiliated companies, as well as Pierre and Liz Buljan, who provided a $2.5 million loan guarantee for the construction, as defendants, and alleges breach of contract and breach of guarantee, among other things.
The LLC, controlled by Yuan, is asking for relief on nearly $32.5 million in secured and unsecured debt, plus $5 million in interest, as well as a foreclosure on the property to assure the debt is paid off.
But the litigation didn’t stop there.
In November, the Buljans, who are Peninsula-based Compass agents, countersued, alleging that Sadeghi; Yuan and his wife Sherry, also known as Hongyu Zhong; and their agents, Delia Fei and Ron Gable, who are also with Compass, misled the couple about the state of the project and how much of an impact the $2.5 million guarantee would have on closing escrow.
“These parties never intended for the loan Mr. Buljan guaranteed to be used to complete construction and close escrow,” according to the countersuit.
In a cross-complaint, the Yuans denied those allegations, saying Buljan “had made a complete investigation and was aware of the true facts and circumstances.”
In late April, attorneys for all parties appeared — over Zoom, appropriately enough — at a hearing where the Yuans’ attorney, Daniel Chung with Spencer Fane, informed the court that the plaintiffs have depositions and discovery pending. The case was continued until July 25. Chung and attorneys for the Buljans and Sadeghi did not respond to requests for comment. Fei and Gable declined to comment.
The pending litigation has not stopped the 1.3-acre, seemingly completed property from coming to market with a nearly $55 million dollar price tag.
Compass agents Mary and Brent Gullixson have the listing and declined to comment on the suits or the property.
The listing website for the property describes “just completed extraordinary new construction” centered around a main residence with 14,700 square feet, including a two-car garage.
It has eight bedrooms, 10 full baths, three half-baths, a home theater and fitness center, and 11-foot ceilings on the main and lower levels.
The amenities are also plentiful: a two-car detached garage and a two-car carport, all wired for electric vehicle charging; a poolside cabana with a fireplace and bathroom; a saltwater pool with spa and glass wall; a tennis/pickleball court; and a fruit and vegetable garden.
A failed escrow


Sadeghi bought the property from its long-time owners for $8.1 million in 2016 through Linda Flora Holdings LLC, according to public records.
In 2018, he filed permits to demolish the existing property and build a new one, which he estimated would cost about $4.7 million for the main residence, according to city permits.
The Yuans, through an LLC named Marigoldyzp, signed on to buy the property in early 2021, putting down a $1.1 million deposit, court documents show. To fund the construction, Marigoldyzp signed onto a $28.4 million loan.
In March 2022, Atherton issued a Stop Notice because the construction was not yet complete and had gone beyond the allowable time line for the 2018 permit.
In order to get the project going again, Sadeghi asked the Buljans in October 2022 to guarantee the $2.5 million loan, which contained a stipulation that work had to be completed by April 30, 2023.
The Yuans also made several smaller additional payments to Sadeghi for construction, according to the complaint, but balked when he asked for an additional $8.14 million in July of 2023 to complete the project and pay for ongoing costs.
Sadeghi “knowingly participated in a scheme that he knew would result in harm” to Yuans’ LLC, “in order to obtain a continual flow of liquidity he could access to pay personal and business expenses,” according to the suit.
When Marigoldyzp refused to hand over more to finish construction, Sadeghi allegedly stopped construction and refused to close escrow.
In an email to agent Ron Gable explaining the need for the additional millions, Sadeghi argued that the $8.14 million simply covered carrying costs including mortgages, debt costs, property taxes, insurance and utilities since the Yuans entered into contract on the home in 2021, court records show.
“It has cost millions of dollars a year simply to keep the lights on at 88 [Tuscaloosa] and it’s not fair for me to get buried and lose my health as a result,” Sadeghi said in the email.
He added that “Covid, a lengthy payment process, hundreds of changes and meetings, and other unforeseen factors have caused construction to stop and start over and over again.”
He closed out his request by saying, “We need an outcome where BOTH sides can walk away healthy, safe and with their shirt on their back. As it stands now, I can’t afford to close this deal and this process has stretched me out to the point that it is literally killing me.”


The Buljans countersuit also paints a similar picture, one where the Yuans’ “significant changes” drove up both the costs and timeline of the project.
The Yuans allegedly strung Sadeghi along by promising him “various extrinsic business deals, including other real estate development, to induce him to continue work on the property,” the countersuit said.
“Ali Sadeghi was willing to continue incurring these costs because Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan were continually promising him that he would be able to make money in other ways outside the transaction through developing a personal and business relationship with Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan,” it went on. “All this time no party sought to close the escrow on the purchase of the property.”

A Park Slope townhouse once home to a fashion executive claimed the top spot in Brooklyn’s contract signings last week.
The 4,400-square-foot home at 178 Garfield Place, asking $6 million, was the priciest of 18 luxury homes in the borough to find buyers last week, according to Compass’ weekly report on properties asking $2 million or more.
The four-story townhouse, built in the 1880s, has five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a garden, terrace and cellar.
It was once owned by Jenna Lyons, the former creative director and president of J. Crew. Lyons, now one of the stars of Bravo’s “Real Housewives of New York” series, sold the home to British musician Vince Clarke and his wife, Tracey Hurley, for
$4 million
in 2012.
Jeremy Stein of Sotheby’s International Realty had the listing.
The second most expensive home to go into contract was a condo unit at 171 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights listed at $5.9 million. The 2,400-square-foot apartment has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.


Unit 5B also features white oak floors, paneled ceilings and a gourmet kitchen.
Compass’ Paolo Sciarra had the listing.
The 32-unit building, known as the Standish, has attracted a star-studded list of buyers. Matt Damon broke borough records when he bought a penthouse for
$16.8 million
in 2018. That same year, married actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt paid
$11 million

Amenities at the building, built in 1903, include a rooftop terrace, fitness center and 24-hour security.

.
The average asking price for the 18 homes was $3.3 million, or $1,395 per square foot. They spent an average of 119 days on the market and had no average discount from their original listing price.

David Zaslav is trying again to get rid of his Greenwich Village townhouse.
The CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery listed his home at 34 West 11th Street for $21.9 million, Curbed
reported
. The listing price works out to roughly $3,835 per square foot.
The 22-foot-wide, four-story home has four bedrooms. The home has multiple fireplaces and a terrace on the top floor, and a backyard that can be seen from the living room.
Zaslav renovated the Green Revival home, raising the ceilings of the lower floors, adding windows and installing an elevator.
Zaslav bought the home in 2016 for $11.8 million, before spending an unspecified amount on renovations. He’s been marketing the property on and off since 2020, including listing the property
for $25 million
in the summer of 2023; Zaslav’s first listing was for $17 million, according to
Zillow
.


A Corcoran team including Deborah Grubman and David Adler have the
listing
. Agents from Sotheby’s previously had the listing.
Zaslav has plenty of real estate ties to New York City, not to mention his company, which leases 1.5 million square feet at 30 Hudson Yards (though it recently
subleased a chunk
of that to trading firm Susquehanna International Group).
In 2010, he bought a duplex on Central Park West from another entertainment figure, Conan O’Brien, for $25 million. Zaslav also once rented another townhouse in Greenwich Village while renovations were happening at 34 West 11th Street; lore has it that the rental is where Zaslav negotiated the acquisition of Warner Media in 2021.
Down the street, a townhouse sold last year at 138-140 West 11th Street
for $72.5 million
in an off-market deal, representing a record for the Downtown Manhattan townhouse market.

World Series champion Eric Hosmer sold an 8-acre spec estate in Southwest Ranches for $15.5 million. The mansion, styled after a European chateau, marks the town’s priciest home sale so far this year.
Records show Hosmer’s Mimi Florida Partners Land Trust, managed by attorney M. Scott Kleiman, sold the mansion at 6232 Hancock Road to Le Chateau Hancock Land Trust. The true buyer is unknown.
Jill Hertzberg
and Jonathan Mann of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty had the listing, and Bryan Levy of Cisca Real Estate brought the buyer.


Hosmer is a newly retired baseball player. He started his Major League Baseball career in 2011 playing for the Kansas City Royals, and won the World Series with them in 2015. In 2018, he moved to the San Diego Padres, where he played until 2022. He had stints with the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs before announcing his retirement in February, according to published reports.

Inter Miami champion Sergio Busquets closed on a waterfront home in Broward County on Friday, a day before winning the Leagues Cup,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Busquets, considered one of the best defensive midfielders in the game, paid about $8.7 million for the seven-bedroom, six-and-a-half bathroom house at 7 Seneca Road in Sea Ranch Lakes, sources told
TRD
.
The village, a small town about 5 miles away from Inter Miami’s Fort Lauderdale stadium, was rumored to be where
Lionel Messi was living
after he was spotted shopping at the Publix supermarket in Sea Ranch Lakes. Messi and Busquets are longtime teammates and friends.
Busquets and his wife Elena Galera acquired the 7,100-square-foot home from Renovation7 LLC, a company led by Beth and David Geduld. Beth Geduld, who designed the home, confirmed the sale, but declined to comment on the buyer. She said the sale marks a record for Sea Ranch Lakes, a mostly waterfront and gated community.
The 0.3-acre property was on the market with Veroushka Volkert of Coldwell Banker for nearly $9 million. Volkert did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The house was just completed. It has about 100 feet of frontage on Lake Seneca and includes a three-car garage, according to the listing.
Busquets played for FC Barcelona from 2008 until earlier this year, when he and Messi joined Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer team owned by brothers Jorge and Jose Mas, David Beckham and other investors. Inter Miami won the Leagues Cup final on Saturday night against Nashville SC in a penalty kick shootout to break a tie, according to
USA Today
.


Inter Miami plays at Drive Pink stadium in Fort Lauderdale and trains next door at the Florida Blue Training Center. The team expects to eventually move to Miami, where its owners plan
Miami Freedom Park
, a massive mixed-use development that will include a soccer stadium on the city-owned Melreese Country Club property just east of Miami International Airport.
Messi’s arrival in Miami has created a huge buzz. Messi, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time, owns three units
in Sunny Isles Beach
but does not appear to be living in them. He and his family have been house hunting in Broward and Palm Beach counties, brokers say.

Designer and real estate investor Tommy Hilfiger sold a lakefront home in Palm Beach for $28 million.
Records show Villa Deniz LLC, an entity linked to Hilfiger’s T Capital Management, sold the house at 313 Dunbar Road to Steven and Kiki Esrick.
Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing, and
Gary Pohrer
of Douglas Elliman brought the buyer.
Steven Esrick co-founded National Business Solutions, a St. Petersburg-based employee leasing firm, in 1990. In 1996, he sold it to Rochester, New York-based Paychex for 3 million shares, then valued at $142 million, the
Tampa Bay Times
reported. Since then, he has invested in real estate developments and private equity deals through his Esrick Enterprises, and served as an executive producer for the Broadway show Hairspray, his LinkedIn shows. Records show he and his wife also own a waterfront North Palm Beach home they bought for $4.5 million in 2008.


Hilfiger
founded his namesake fashion line in 1985. He sold it for $1.6 billion in 2005, according to published reports. A longtime Palm Beach resident, Hilfiger and his wife, Dee Ocleppo Hilfiger, are regular investors in residential properties on the island. In June, they flipped a house for
$41.4 million
, five months after buying it for
$36.9 million
. In 2022, they flipped a Palm Beach house to Fox News host Bret Baier for
$12 million
. Baier upsized to a
$37 million
island home in August. The Hilfigers also bought
a 3-acre oceanfront estate for $46.3 million
in 2021.
They bought the Dunbar Road home for
$21 million
that same year, records show. The 5,000-square-foot house was built in 2006 on 0.3 waterfront acres, according to property records. It has three bedrooms, four bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, a pool and a dock, records show. The couple tapped designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard to redesign the interiors, according to the
Architectural Digest
video featuring the home.
The Hilfigers listed it for $35.9 million in October, Redfin shows. It sold for $7.9 million below the asking price.
Despite the market cooling off post-pandemic, it’s been a busy season for Palm Beach real estate. The island’s most expensive home on the market, Tarpon Island, listed for $187.5 million,
found a buyer
. Earlier this month, Payday loan tycoon Allan Jones bought a mansion from one of Chicago’s richest families for
$29.3 million
. The heiress to a vast baking powder and tobacco fortune sold her Palm Beach home for
$15.9 million
last month.

Gracie Abrams is the latest star-studded buyer at a Greenwich Village co-op.
The 25-year-old singer-songwriter paid $5.5 million for a penthouse at 1 Fifth Avenue, according to public records. The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.
The nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is
known for housing celebrities
like the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.
Abrams’ new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.
The co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.


Sotheby’s International’s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.
Capdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.
Amenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.
Award-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,
purchased the apartment
directly above hers for $3.3 million.
Keith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million — roughly
$1 million less
than they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.

Basketball’s greatest of all time paid $16.5 million for a second mansion in Jupiter — not the planet, but the Palm Beach County town.
Michael Jordan acquired the 9,100-square-foot, five-bedroom home at 103 West
Bears Club
Drive, according to property records. The former NBA champion and business mogul purchased the nearly 1-acre property via an Illinois LLC he controls.
Dr. Michael A. Murphy, founder and CEO of AirWayz and a former AirSculpt Technologies board member, and his wife Marla sold the home to Bull &amp; Bear LLC. It’s located inside the Bear’s Club, a luxury gated community that includes a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. Nicklaus founded the Bear’s Club in 1999 with his wife, Barbara Nicklaus.
Jordan’s new home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a four-car garage, a guest house and a club room. It was built in 2017, records show. Jeremy Browne and Thomas Hughes with Compass represented the Murphys, according to Redfin. Maria Prieto of Keller Williams Capital Realty, Jordan’s mother-in-law, represented the Jordan LLC. The agents declined to comment.


The property previously sold for $8.3 million in 2017, records show.


Jordan and his wife, Yvette Prieto, live nearby on a larger 3-acre estate at 172 Bears Club Drive. That property has a 28,000-square-foot home spanning three structures, which includes a guard house, guest house, pool and an athletic wing with a basketball court and gym, according to a

Despite

Celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Leonard Hochstein purchased a waterfront home in Miami, amid his divorce from Real Housewives star Lisa Hochstein.
Hochstein, known as the “Boob God,” bought the 2,900-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom home at 1161 Belle Meade Island Drive in Miami through a family trust. Property records show an entity led by Haitian American fashion designer Kerby Jean-Raymond sold the house for $6.8 million.
The Belle Meade property sold at a loss. The Jean-Raymond-led LLC paid $7.5 million for the house in April 2022.
Hochstein
, who goes by Lenny, has been going through a highly publicized divorce from Lisa Hochstein, who recently moved from their Star Island mansion to a
luxury condo
she is renting in South Beach. The divorce was a prominent storyline in the last season of “The Real Housewives of Miami.” Although the divorce is not yet final, he is now engaged to model Katharina Mazepa.
Hochstein paid $2 million for the home at 42
Star Island
Drive in 2012. The couple tore down the previous house to build the three-story, 18,000-square-foot mansion that exists today.


Hochstein said he is working on plans to build a “beautiful home” on the property as an investment. He said he is happy with his Star Island mansion.
“I’m always looking at opportunities to buy something special and I think this property is special,” he said. “Anytime I can get almost 120 feet of water frontage on a wide bay — there are not too many places like that.”


The Belle Meade property features 116 feet of open bay water frontage, according to the listing. It was on the market with Compass agents Ben Moss and Michelle Northern. Moss declined to comment.
The single-story house was built in 1956 on a 0.4-acre lot and has a pool and dock, according to the listing, which offers it as a possible redevelopment property.
Home prices in Belle Meade have increased dramatically in recent years. This month, Tom Cruz, a real estate investor-influencer who made his wealth in Section 8 housing, spent
$17.8 million
for the nearby waterfront mansion at 1125 Belle Meade Island Drive, setting a neighborhood record.

Rex Tillerson didn’t last long as Donald Trump’s Secretary of State. But even his cabinet tenure may prove to be lengthier than the amount of time his Washington, D.C. townhouse will spend on the market.
Tillerson listed his townhouse in the capital’s ritzy Kalorama neighborhood for $6.5 million, according to
Robb Report
. The listing came nearly seven years after the former Exxon chief executive officer
snatched up the property
at 1832 24th Street Northwest for $5.5 million.
While Tillerson and his wife have owned the townhouse for seven years, it barely took seven days for the couple to receive an acceptable offer on the pad. The home went under contract 11 days after being put up for sale, according to its
listing
.
The purchase price — if the Tillersons get what they want — would break down to roughly $1,140 per square foot.
The 1920s townhouse has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and three powder rooms across 5,700 square feet and four floors.
The ground floor includes a laundry room, an office and a lounge that opens out to a courtyard-style garden in the rear. The home also has a terrace with a built-in barbecue and detached two-car garage.


Compass’ Mark McFadden and Hunter McFadden share the listing. Mark McFadden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from
The Real Deal
.
The neighborhood has been home to a who’s who of power players in politics and beyond, including Chris Wallace, Jeff Bezos and the Obamas.
Tillerson’s townhouse may have arrived around the time of his appointment, but far outlasted his time with the Trump administration. After being sworn in as Secretary of State on Feb. 1, 2017, the relationship between the two business titans quickly collapsed, including an incident reported by NBC in which Tillerson called his boss a “moron.”
Tillerson was axed in March 2018, and claimed at the time he learned of his dismissal from a tweet posted by Trump.

Sale Price (text): The sale price of the main property discussed in the article, which is a parking spot at 150 Charles, is $500,000.
Sale Price (int): nan


Content:
The Witkoff Group’s plan to sell parking spots at its 150 Charles has landed the developer in a dispute with condo owners.
The developer started offering spots for $500,000 a pop in what Alex Witkoff told the
New York Post
was a solution to the West Village’s “huge parking problem that will only get worse with time.”
“With many West Village locations lacking garages and many neighborhood buildings converting garages to condos, 150 Charles St offers savvy buyers a rare opportunity to own a parking spot in prime West Village,” Witkoff said in a statement on the sale, which is being handled by Serhant.
The developer said the tight inventory has made for “unprecedented” interest from 150 Charles residents and local residents. But some at the
celebrity-studded building
took issue with the developer’s plan, which in addition to the hefty purchase price, includes a $500 a month maintenance fee with an annual escalation, according to an amendment to the condo’s offering plan.
A group of owners pushed back with an offer to buy 25 to 30 of the spaces for $10 million, or roughly $330,000 to $400,000 per spot, according to a memo obtained by
The Real Deal
. The memo raised concerns about the operation of the garage, citing security issues and expenses “all of which have the potential to impact the value of not just the parking easements, but our homes at 150 Charles.”
The memo also called for a limit to the fee raises, pushed for the title to the garage to be transferred to the condo board after 90 percent of the spaces had been sold, and asked that 90 percent of the spaces be held exclusively for condo owners.
A source familiar with the matter denied the developer received an offer, but an email about the memo indicated it was shared with the Witkoff Group.


The valet-attended garage, completed in 2015, includes 92 spaces up for sale, which were previously available to owners and the public for rent. The garage closed to renters at the end of May, according to an email obtained by
TRD.
A spokesperson for the developer said the spots were “already significantly sold,” but declined to share the specific number.
Witkoff filed the amendment spelling out the parking details back in 2021, but 150 Charles residents raised concerns about the proposal earlier this year as the rental expiration approached, according to emails.
The developer’s $500,000 asking price is steep for a parking space, but as the Post noted, not unheard of in Manhattan where
monthly parking costs
have ranked as the most expensive in the country. Another downtown building at 42 Crosby Street once marketed 10 spots for $1 million each.


Witkoff launched sales at the 91-unit project in 2013, eight years after buying the former warehouse for $85 million. The building sold out in just three months with a buyer roster chock full of A-list names and corporate bigwigs, including singer Jon Bon Jovi, model Irina Shayk and Hard Rock Café co-founder Peter Morton.
The 15-story building also made headlines last year when one of its penthouses sold for
$52 million
, or $11,500 per square foot. The seller, an entity linked to former Credit Suisse executive Robert Shafir, bought the apartment for $29 million in 2016.

Fox News host Bret Baier sold a Palm Beach house, after upsizing to a $37 million home on the island in August.
Baier and his wife, Amy Baier, sold the house at 244 Fairview Road for $13.5 million, Redfin shows. The sale comes nearly two years after they bought it from designer and island real estate investor Tommy Hilfiger for
$12 million
. The deed has yet to be recorded publicly, and the buyer is unknown.
Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate represented both sides of the deal. Angle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sale.
Bret Baier is the longtime anchor of Fox News’ early evening newscast “Special Report.” He is also the channel’s chief political correspondent and co-anchor for 2024 election coverage. Baier renewed his contract with Fox early, in September,
Variety
reported.


The 4,200-square-foot non-waterfront Fairview Road home was built in 2021 on 0.3-acres, property records show. It has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool. The Baiers listed it for $16.5 million in June, and dropped the asking price to $15.9 million in October, Redfin shows.
In August, the Baiers bought another Palm Beach home from the wife of a Boston real estate developer for
$37 million
in an off-market deal. The non-waterfront house at 125 Wells Road spans 6,700 square feet, with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and one half-bathroom.
Baier isn’t the only conservative media player to own real estate in Palm Beach. Fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity bought a townhouse on the island in 2021 for
$5.3 million
, and won
approval for an expansion
in 2022. He recently announced he is moving to Florida full time, and is conducting his broadcasts from his home in Palm Beach, according to the
Guardian
.
Fox News’ late founder, Roger Ailes, who was ousted from leadership of the company in 2016 following a bevy of sexual harassment allegations,
bought a $36 million mansion
in Palm Beach that year. He died on the island in 2017.
In April, cosmetics heir William Lauder bought the late conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh’s 2.7 acre oceanfront compound in Palm Beach for
$155 million
. Considered a teardown, Lauder began demolition of the estate in July, according to published reports.

Isaiah Stewart, the starting power forward for the Detroit Pistons, engaged in a unique pre-game routine before facing off against the Miami Heat in their regular season opener.
The 22-year-old basketball star forwent the typical attractions Miami had to offer and embarked on a mission to locate a notary public to complete the closing papers for his recent investment property back in his hometown of Rochester, N.Y., the
Rochester Business Journal reported
.
Stewart, a former standout at the University of Washington, acquired the Colony Apartments on Lake Avenue in Rochester through his limited liability company, 1361 Lake Ave LLC, for $2.1 million.
K Holdings LLC, overseen by Pavel Klimovich, sold the property, the outlet said, citing records filed with the Monroe County Clerk’s Office.
The four-story property, built in 1968, includes 51 units and spans 34,000 square feet.


Stewart was drafted by the Portland Trailblazers in the first round of the 2020 NBA draft, later becoming part of a draft-and-trade deal that sent him to the Pistons. In July, he signed a four-year contract extension worth $64 million, solidifying his place as one of Rochester’s highest-earning professional athletes.
He remained committed to his hometown through investments like the Colony Apartments purchase, as well as organizing basketball camps and treating members of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Rochester to a Pistons game in Detroit.
NBA stars past and present have been known to make forays into real estate. Four-time champion
Andre Iguodala announced in late October
that he will run $200 million venture capital fund Mosaic, the New York Times
reported
. The 39-year-old, who retired from professional basketball during the offseason, raised the fund with longtime business partner Rudy Cline-Thomas.
Mosaic is focused on seed- and early-stage investments for companies in the enterprise software, fintech health care and sports company sectors. But one its first investments is in Vessel, a multifamily modular builder.

Title: Madonna’s former waterfront Miami mansion sells at a loss
Subhead: House is next door to Ken Griffin’s estate

Content:
A hidden buyer with ties to Chicago picked up a waterfront Miami mansion next to billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin’s estate. The Coconut Grove property once belonged to the Queen of Pop, Madonna.
Property records show wealth manager Paul Morelli, trustee of Brickell Holdings Trust, sold the 8,400-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion at 3029 Brickell Avenue to a company that is managed by the same Chicago-based professional services firm. Morelli, a managing partner at San Francisco-based Vernal Point Advisors, is also listed on the buyer’s LLC.
The 1.2-acre property traded for $20.3 million, marking a loss compared to its previous $29 million sale price in late 2021. Madonna owned the estate from 1992 to 2000. It was built in 1928 and includes a dock and 100 feet of water frontage.
The same hidden buyer owns the house immediately northeast of the property. The entity
paid $48.5 million
for the 1.5-acre parcel at 3007 Brickell Avenue in March, records show. Together, the adjacent properties total 2.7 acres. The owner could combine and redevelop the homes into a larger estate.


Developer David Martin and his wife, Christina, own the house next door to 3007 Brickell Avenue. It is under construction.
Griffin’s property, at 3115 Brickell Avenue, is on the opposite side of the mansion that just sold. Griffin paid
nearly $107 million
for Adrienne Arsht’s former 4-acre waterfront Miami estate a year ago. Months after purchasing the property, Griffin proposed moving one of the homes, which is historic,
sparking criticism
from preservationists. The Citadel founder and CEO recently
moved Citadel
and Citadel Securities’ headquarters to Miami from Chicago.
Sources say Griffin is not the buyer of the other adjacent homes. A spokesperson for Griffin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Citadel plans a waterfront tower nearby at 1201
Brickell
Bay Drive, which will serve as the company’s headquarters.

Subhead: Home design icon, daughter bought at the Belnord

Martha Stewart tied up a condo buy at an iconic building on the Upper West Side.
The home and hospitality business woman and her daughter, television host Alexis Stewart, paid $12.3 million for a duplex at the Belnord — a 213-unit redevelopment project on Broadway and West 86th Street, according to a deed first reported by
Crain’s New York
.
The purchase comes about a year after Stewart
found a buyer
for her West Village triplex. The 9,500-square-foot condo at 165 Charles Street, reported to be her daughter’s New York City home, sold in July for
$31 million
, down from its initial $53 million asking price in 2019.
The Stewarts’ new home is at the top of the 12-story building developed by Westbrook Partners, which took over the project in 2021 from HFZ Capital. The firm is now embroiled in an onslaught of litigation, with
former executive Nir Meir
facing criminal charges alleging he orchestrated an $86 million fraud scheme.
When sales launched in 2017, the Belnord’s offering plan set the asking price for the Stewarts’ pad at $18 million. It later dropped to $13 million, as the developer lowered other prices at the building to contend with a slowing condo market in the years ahead of the pandemic.
The apartment has six bedrooms, living room with a fireplace, formal dining room and views of the building’s landscaped courtyard.


Corcoran’s Richard Ziegelasch represented the Stewarts in the deal. Douglas Elliman’s Maya Kadouri had the listing.
Exterior images of the Belnord are known as the fictional co-op called the Arconia in Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building.”
The 1900s rental building-turned-condo has a projected sellout of $1.3 billion, but sales progress is slow because the developer is renovating and offloading units as they become available. So far, the developer has sold about half of the units with prices ranging from $870,000 to nearly $14 million, according to Marketproof.
Martha Stewart sold her company — Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which published her magazine known as Martha Stewart Living — to Sequential Brands in 2015 for around $353 million. Her latest ventures include marijuana-derivative-infused candles and a cover photoshoot for Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue last year.

Inside 111 West 57th is a condo fit for a king.
An entity tied to King Charles III appears to be the latest buyer at the Billionaires’ Row tower developed by JDS Development and Property Markets Group — and the last to scoop up a unit in the landmarked Steinway Hall portion of the building, according to public records.
A buyer under the moniker “His Majesty the King in Right of Canada” paid $6.6 million for Unit 11A, one of the supertall’s 14 residences located in the storied piano brand’s former flagship store and concert hall.
The deed was signed by Robert McCubbing, the senior trade commissioner and director of trade and investment at the Consulate General of Canada in New York.
King Charles III took over as the sovereign ruler of Canada, a constitutional monarchy and member of the British Commonwealth, upon the passing of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.
The three-bedroom apartment traded for more than $4 million off its initial asking price. The condo, which spans 3,600 square feet, hit the market for $10.8 million in February of 2022.
Despite notching a
string of discounts
since sales launched in 2018, the supertall has snagged a number of pricey deals, including a penthouse sold for
$53 million
in October. The all-cash deal closed for $7 million less than the asking price listed in the building’s offering plan.
Douglas Elliman’s Erin Boisson Aries and Thomas Aabo, who represented the buyer, declined to comment through a spokesperson.


Corcoran’s Joe Alvarez, Kane Manera and Janet Wang have headed sales at the 60-residence building since Feb. 2022, when the firm
replaced
Douglas Elliman Development Marketing. The team declined to comment through a spokesperson.
Amenities in the 91-story tower include a swimming pool with private cabanas, a fitness center, private dining room and golf simulator.
The apartment appears to be the latest addition to luxury apartments in the city tied to the Commonwealth. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth,
TRD
found 24 properties
across New York owned by entities named with some variation of “Her Majesty the Queen.”
Alongside the recent purchase, the crown owns several properties near the United Nations, including three units at International Plaza at 303 East 43rd Street, two at 309-321 East 49th Street and one at the Horizon at 415 East 37th Street.
A 2015 sale at
Zeckendorf Development’s 50 United Nations Plaza
in the name of “Her Majesty The Queen In Right of New Zealand” sparked blowback from New Zealand’s Labour Party after it was revealed the nearly $8 million unit would be occupied by the New Zealand mission to the United Nations.
Other holdings include a set of units on the Upper West Side, with the crown possessing three units at 107-113 West 89th Street, a condo at 103 West 89th Street and a unit 211 West 71st Street.
On the east side, Commonwealth-related entities appeared to own five units at Evans Towers at 171 East 84th Street, four at Le Chambord at 350 East 72nd Street and two at the Wakefield at 525 East 80th Street.

Her husband may be on tour, but Sybi Kuchar has a new view to enjoy in Tequesta.
The wife of golf pro Matt Kuchar bought a flipped waterfront estate in the northern Palm Beach County enclave for $12.5 million. Records show she bought the home at 11 Dewitt Place from food industry mogul Benjamin Aiello’s 11 Ben’s Place LLC in an off-market deal.
Sybi Kuchar’s husband, Matt Kuchar, launched his professional golf career in 2000, and remains on the PGA Tour. He currently holds the 54th place in the world ranking, and the 47th spot among money leaders.
Aiello is the former owner of Madison, New Jersey-based Gourmet Dining, which provides food service to universities in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The United Kingdom-based food service conglomerate Compass Group bought the firm in 2014, according to its website. Compass Group’s annual revenue for the year ending in September was $39.9 billion, its website shows.


Aiello and his wife, Bernadette Aiello, are regular investors in Palm Beach County real estate. They sold a waterfront
Admirals Cove
spec mansion in May for
$17.8 million
, after buying the land for $9.9 million in 2021. Records show they also own an Admirals Cove condo they bought for $750,000 in 2021.
Aiello bought the 7,100-square-foot Tequesta estate for $11 million in April, records show. Built in 1991 on 2.1 acres, it was renovated and expanded in 2011, a previous listing shows. The compound includes a six-bedroom main house, a two-bedroom guest house and a total of 10 bathrooms and one half-bathroom. The estate also has a pool, library, tennis court, private beach and dock, according to the listing.
With the latest sale, Aiello’s flip equates to $1.5 million, or nearly 14 percent in price growth in nine months.
For Kuchar, the waterfront compound is a second Palm Beach County home. Records show she also owns a condo in the gated golf community the
Bear’s Club
, which she bought last year for $6 million.
Northern Palm Beach County’s luxury real estate market is a magnet for pro golfers and their families. Justin Thomas, who won the PGA Championship in 2017 and 2022, bought a waterfront spec mansion in
Jupiter for $13.5 million
in 2022. He sold a smaller Jupiter home for
$3.1 million
in July. Pro golfer Dustin Johnson bought an Admirals Cove home for
$14 million
in 2021.

Judy Garland’s former Bel Air home, built the same year she was cast in “The Wizard of Oz,” has traded for $11.1 million,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Escrow closed Friday on the nearly 2.7-acre estate at 1231 Stone Canyon Road. Property records show a trust tied to Jill and Merrill Chozen sold the home.
Josh Flagg of Compass was the listing agent, while Carolwood Estates’ Sebastian Spader and Kevin Dees represented the buyer. Both declined to comment on the buyer.
The home, which was originally listed for $11.5 million in March, is located about a mile from Sunset Boulevard and a few blocks from the Hotel Bel-Air.
Garland was 16 years old when the home was built and commissioned famed architect Wallace Neff to design the estate. Neff is often credited with defining California-style architecture, with his work drawing influences from Spain and the Mediterranean.
The home has since been linked with other celebrity residents, including Quincy Jones and Marvin Gaye. Property records show the most recent seller acquired the property from Stephanie Booth Murray, the great-great granddaughter of Times Mirror Company founder Harrison Gray Otis.


The 5,500-square-foot home has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It includes a gated driveway, iron staircase anchoring the home’s formal entry, chef’s kitchen with a marble island, pool and writer’s cottage.
Garland’s former home is the latest residential deal in the popular Bel Air market.
The trade comes on the heels of serial entrepreneur Jonathan Gray’s $23 million purchase last month of 657 Perugia Way from Palmer Murray, who is the chair of financial services firm LourdMurray.
In May, Erewhon owners Anthony and Josephine Antoci bought 755 Sarbonne Road from VistaJet founder and chair Thomas Flohr. The couple of the upscale organic and wellness grocer paid $22.5 million for the mansion.

George Clooney is handing over the keys to his Studio City home after selling it for $14.5 million on Friday.
The home at 3240 Iredell Lane is located in Studio City’s Fryman Canyon area, a woody neighborhood flush with exclusivity and gated estates.
The mystery buyer was someone from the entertainment industry, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.
Westside Estate Agency co-founder Kurt Rappaport represented Clooney. Carolwood Estates’ Kevin Dees represented the buyer.
Rappaport and Dees both declined comment on the deal.


Clooney was a long-term holder of the estate.
The actor paid Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks $2.2 million for it in 1995, a year after Michael Crichton’s “ER” series on NBC began airing and propelled Clooney and many of his co-stars to fame. Clooney starred in the medical drama for five seasons.
“I was in the second season of ‘ER’ living in a little house and I thought, ‘Well, maybe it’s time to get a little bit larger house off the street, so I wouldn’t fall prey to every photographer,’” Clooney said of his decision to buy the home in a 2012 episode of CBS’ “Person to Person.”
The Studio City property is just one part of a larger portfolio of homes in New York, Italy and France owned by Clooney and wife Amal.
The six-bed, six-bath main house totals over 7,000 square feet and sits on more than 3 acres, according to Zillow. There’s also a sports court and pool. Major renovation work to the property was completed in the fall of 2022 and included the addition of two villas, with the Clooneys reportedly paying $1 million for the expansion.

As superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers enters his first season with the New York Jets, he’s found the ideal place to R-E-L-A-X.
Rodgers purchased a mansion in ritzy Montclair, New Jersey, the Daily Mail
reported
. The $9.5 million sale took place towards the end of June, but the identity of the buyer had been kept under wraps and remains unconfirmed by the athlete himself.
The quarterback arguably scored a deal for the home at 349 Crestmont Road, straddling the line with Cedar Grove; the new build was put on the market for $11 million in May, according to a
property history on Zillow
. The contract was signed within three weeks of that listing.
Joan Barrett of Stanton Realtors held the
listing
. The brokerage did not respond to a request for comment from
The Real Deal
.
Exact square footage for the property was not publicly available, but the
New York Post
pinned the main home at greater than 4,000 square feet. The property as a whole spans more than two acres and was purchased through a limited liability company, the publication added.


The mansion includes eight bedrooms and ten bathrooms. There are panoramic views of the New York City skyline and a bevy of luxury features. The main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and walk-in dressing room. There’s also a gourmet kitchen, home office, media room, gym, wine cellar and three-car carriage.
Maybe most importantly, the home is only a 20-minute drive from MetLife Stadium, where the Jets play their home games.
The four-time NFL MVP and one-time Super Bowl champion owns a $28 million property in Malibu, California, as well as homes in Chico, California, Texas and Tennessee. He also still owns a three-and-a-half acre property in Wisconsin, though he has yet to list the home close to the franchise where he’s played his entire career to this point, the Green Bay Packers.

Retired boxing champion turned real estate investor Floyd Mayweather Jr. sold his waterfront Miami Beach mansion for $22 million.
Mayweather, via his Fojoso LLC, sold the 10,853-square-foot house at 288 South Coconut Lane to a company managed by Morris Betesh, according to records. Betesh is a former senior managing director at Meridian Capital Group who recently launched a new venture. The sale appears to have been arranged off-market.
The buying entity, 288 SC LLC, assumed Mayweather’s $13 million mortgage. Hankey Capital is the lender. The next loan payment due in December is $98,736, records show.
Mayweather, who has been investing in commercial real estate, likely made a profit on the Miami Beach home. He
paid $18 million
for the nine-bedroom, 10.5-bathroom estate in 2021, records show. The Palm Island home, on a third of an acre, includes an indoor movie theater, gym, dock, pool and space for about 10 cars. It was built in 2011.
Earlier this year, Chilean developer and casino mogul Claudio Fischer sold his waterfront spec mansion at 40 Palm Avenue
for $40 million,
setting a record for home sales on Palm and Hibiscus islands.
Mayweather previously owned a waterfront home on Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach, which he sold in 2020 at a loss for $6.3 million.


Mayweather has reportedly
earned $1.1 billion
through his boxing career and business ventures, including about $300 million from a fight in 2015.
He’s been ramping up his real estate investments.
Mayweather
recently invested
in 601W Companies’ $10 billion portfolio of 18 office buildings spanning 10 million square feet, including properties in New York, Chicago and Jersey City, marking his “most significant” investment to date,
The Real Deal
previously reported.


He also previously invested more than $100 million with office landlord SL Green.
In October, he went into contract on

Former Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander may have left New York City behind, but his penthouse apartment in Gramercy Park is proving harder to abandon.
Alexander slashed another $13 million off the price for his penthouse unit at 18 Gramercy Park South, the New York Post
reported
. The unit is now asking $32 million, a far cry from the initial $50 million in a 2015 listing.
“With the seller no longer living in New York and not utilizing the home, combined with a challenging election year and fluctuating markets, the message has become clear — it’s time to sell,” Douglas Elliman’s Eleonora Srugo, who holds the listing, told the Post.
Last February, the apartment was marketed
for $43.8 million
. That was a knockdown of $5 million from
only a few months earlier
.
Alexander has been trying to sell the apartment on and off since 2015, shuffling through multiple brokers in the process, though the unit wasn’t publicly on the market for a few years in the interim. He purchased it for $43 million in 2013, during the city’s luxury condo boom.


The 6,300-square-foot duplex has four bedrooms, five bathrooms and two half-bathrooms. There’s a private elevator leading into the unit, which is flanked by four outdoor terraces totaling 1,900 square feet.
The first floor has an eat-in chef’s kitchen, a library/cocktail lounge and a staff room. The second floor, accessible by elevator or grand staircase, has a wraparound terrace facing Gramercy Park. The floor also includes a wet bar, a private sun deck with a heated infinity pool and an outdoor hot tub.


Zeckendorf Development
built the 18-story, 16-unit building, which was designed by Robert A.M. Stern. Amenities include a resident manager, doorman, two roof terraces, a club room, a spa and a fitness center.
In marketing the penthouse, Srugo said the reopening of the
Gramercy Park Hotel
could lead to significant appreciation, “bringing the property back to its original valuation.”

Billionaire Jeff Bezos hit “add to cart” and purchased a waterfront estate in Indian Creek Village for $79 million, next to a property he acquired this summer for $68 million.
Bezos bought the nearly 2-acre estate at 12 Indian Creek Island Road, sources told
The Real Deal
. Bloomberg
first reported
the news. The sale of the 19,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom mansion closed on Thursday, according to the Multiple Listing Service.
Dina Goldentayer and Danilo Tavares of Douglas Elliman represented the seller, Indian Creek #1 LLC, according to the listing and property records. The agents declined to comment. Goldentayer and Tavares also represented the buyer.
The sale gives Bezos, the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of more than $155 billion according to Forbes, 4.6 acres of contiguous waterfront land on the island.
Bezos acquired
11 Indian Creek Island Drive
in June
. Both deals total $147 million.
Indian Creek is a guard-gated island north of Miami Beach, where streets are private, allowing only residents and invited guests to enter. His neighbors include billionaire Carl Icahn, hedge funder Eddie Lampert, Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias.


Goldentayer listed the mansion at 12 Indian Creek Island Road for $85 million in May. It includes a home theater, wine cellar, cabana, pool and 200 feet of bay frontage. The estate was built in 2000.
Records show Indian Creek #1 LLC paid $28 million for the property in 2014. Leo Kryss, a co-founder of the Brazilian electronics and toy company Tectoy, is named as a registered agent for the entity, according to a mortgage recorded in 2020.
Bezos and his fiancée, former news anchor and pilot Lauren Sánchez, had been looking for a new or renovated mansion in the Miami area, sources previously told
TRD
. Bezos’ ties to South Florida go back decades. He graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1982.
Last year, his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, purchased
two waterfront homes
in Coral Gables for $78 million.
Though Bezos is the wealthiest person to purchase homes in Miami-Dade this year, he’s not the only billionaire to do so. Billionaire hedge fund manager
Ken Griffin
recently picked up another estate on Miami Beach’s Star Island, giving him nearly 6.5 contiguous waterfront acres.
Eric Schmidt, a former chairman and CEO of Google,
paid $63 million
for two adjacent houses on the Sunset Islands in Miami Beach last month. Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, have been collecting homes on the islands since at least 2020, spending more than $100 million over the past three years according to an analysis of property records and sources.

Los Angeles Clipper Terance Mann has just placed his modern farmhouse-style home in Tarzana on the market.
The Clippers guard is asking $5.6 million for the six-bedroom, seven-bath home at 5124 Calvin Avenue.
Mann wasn’t at the property for long. He bought the San Fernando Valley property in June 2023 for $4.8 million, with Distinct Concierge Real Estate representing him in the deal.
Mann has now enlisted the same brokerage to handle the current listing.
It’s a family matter for Distinct Concierge, with founder and CEO Rod Watson, along with his wife and Managing Partner Laura Watson and daughter Renecia Watson, marketing the home for Mann.
Distinct Concierge specializes in representing clients in the sports and entertainment industries.


The Calvin Avenue home totals 6,282 square feet and sits on a little less than half an acre. The gated property touts a first-floor living room with two-story vaulted ceilings, a movie theater, sports court, pool and pool house.
Mann notably scored a career high 39 points in the Clippers’ 2020-2021 postseason win over the Utah Jazz that sent the L.A. team to the Western Conference finals for the first time ever.
Mann later agreed to a two-year, $22 million contract extension with the Clippers.
“This is the team that drafted me, so they believed in me from the beginning,” Mann told Sports Illustrated at the time of his extension. “The run we had last year, we didn’t go where we wanted to go, so it left a bitter taste. Just being around these guys for a long time, I couldn’t turn that down.”
Mann has appeared in 345 games since entering the NBA in 2019, when he was the 48th draft pick by the Clippers. Last season, he averaged 8.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists.

LeBron James’ former waterfront estate in Coconut Grove traded for $18.5 million, a 44 percent increase compared to its sale price in 2021.
Jeff Conry, former president of the charter airline iAero Airways, and his wife, Sherianne Conry, sold the six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom home at 3590 Crystal View Court in Miami, property records show. John Lie-Nielson and Darling Nielsen bought the nearly 14,000-square-foot mansion.
John Lie-Nielson is founder and CEO of One Park Financial, a Coconut Grove-based financial firm. He and his wife financed the deal with a $13 million mortgage from Bank of America.
The Conrys
paid $12.8 million
for the nearly half-acre property in May of 2021. The mansion was built in 2010.
James, the four-time NBA champion who played for the Miami Heat between 2010 and 2014, sold the house
in 2015 for $13.4 million
. Last year, the Los Angeles Laker
paid $9 million
for a condo at Estates at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach.


The Crystal View Court property has 80 feet of water frontage on Biscayne Bay, a private dock, pool, gym and spa, and a three-car garage, according to the listing. Jason Zarco of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty represented the Conrys as their listing agent. Christina Cuervo with C Realty Group represented the buyers.
Zarco had the mansion on the market for $20.5 million. Zarco, who declined to comment on the buyers’ identities, said that the deal went under contract within six weeks of hitting the market.
“The reason we got such a premium [is] there’s nothing on the open bay that’s in great move-in condition in the $20 million range,” he said. His clients are downsizing, he added.
Jeff Conry kept the guest house as it was when James owned the property, with the addition of branding the suite with King James wallpaper and laser edging on the door, Zarco said.
In October, investment manager James Star, who is married to a member of the billionaire Crown family of Chicago,
paid $18 million
for the nearby waterfront lot at 3323 Poinciana Avenue in Coconut Grove. That property traded for more than 200 percent above its sale price two years ago.

Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is ready to get rid of his Upper East Side apartment.
Giuliani listed his co-op at 45 East 66th Street for $6.5 million, Business Insider
reported
. The listing popped up on the market towards the end of July and comes with a complicated history, especially in recent years.
Sotheby’s International Realty’s Serena Boardman has the
listing
. She didn’t comment on the listing to the publication.
Giuliani purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002. The unit had enormous entertainment potential and it has entertained everything from podcast recordings to federal law enforcement agents when It was raided in 2021 by the FBI during its probe into Giuliani’s activities in Ukraine.
A year after the purchase, Giuliani married Judith Nelson on the lawn of Gracie Mansion. The mayor declined to sign a prenuptial agreement with his third wife, a decision that
proved costly 16 years later
when they divorced.


Judith reportedly lived in the unit until May 2019. While Giuliani held on to the co-op after the divorce was done, Judith received the dream home in Water Mill, which she
promptly sold
in 2021 for $5 million.
The three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit includes a wood-burning fireplace, a semi-private elevator landing and it’s located a stone’s throw away from Central Park. Features of the building include a 24-hour doorman and a rule barring construction work during the summer.
Giuliani’s allyship with Donald Trump seems to have landed “America’s Mayor” in hot water. The unit was put up for sale five days before the former president was indicted for his alleged role in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. While not explicitly named, it’s widely believed that “co-conspirator 1” the indictment is none other than Giuliani himself.

Soccer superstar Lionel Messi scooped up a waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale,
The Real Deal
has learned.
Messi and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, acquired a 10,500-square-foot, eight-bedroom estate in Fort Lauderdale’s Bay Colony through a company led by Messi’s wealth manager,
Alfonso Nebot
, records show and a source confirmed to
TRD
.
Messi, who joined Inter Miami in July with great fanfare and has led the team to eight wins and four draws, has been spotted house hunting across South Florida, from Fort Lauderdale to Boca Raton. The longtime Barcelona player won the World Cup championship last year for his native Argentina. Messi is traveling to Bolivia this week to play in the second round of the  2026 World Cup qualifiers.
John and Stacy Dickerson sold the property at 91 Compass Lane to Messi and Roccuzzo for $10.8 million. The Dickersons paid $9 million for the estate in May of last year, which means they sold it for a 20 percent boost in price in 16 months.
The 0.4-acre property has 170 feet of water frontage with two docks, a waterfront pool, a gym/spa room and an Italian kitchen, according to a 2022 listing for the home. The house was built in 1988 and expanded in 2000, property records show.


Messi and Roccuzzo’s primary suite spans a massive 1,600 square feet.
Jennifer Abbott with One Sotheby’s International Realty represented the seller in the off-market deal. Compass agents Samuel and Donna Simpkin represented Messi.
Messi’s home is about 5 miles from Drive Pink Stadium and Inter Miami’s adjacent training facility in Fort Lauderdale. The team expects to eventually move to Miami, where its owners plan
Miami Freedom Park
, a massive mixed-use development that will include a soccer stadium on the city-owned Melreese Country Club property just east of Miami International Airport. The team is owned by Miami businessmen and brothers Jorge and José Mas, as well as David Beckham and other partners.
Messi’s deal with Inter Miami is valued between $50 million and $60 million, plus equity in the team and revenue sharing agreements with Adidas, Apple and other companies.
Messi’s longtime teammate, Sergio Busquets, who joined Inter Miami alongside him, recently paid
about $8.7 million
for a waterfront home in
Sea Ranch Lakes
,
TRD
previously reported. It’s not far from Messi’s new mansion.
Messi also owns three luxury condos
in Sunny Isles Beach
, including a unit at Porsche Design Tower, which was completed by Gil Dezer’s Dezer Development in late 2016.

No starving artists here.
In an analysis of musicians’ priciest residential purchases of 2023, the top performers were Beyoncé and Jay-Z, David Guetta and Jennifer Lopez, according to data collected by Agent Advice.
The most expensive residential deal made by musicians last year was Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s
$190 million purchase
of a 6-acre Malibu
trophy estate
in May. The seller, art collector Bill Bell, Jr., commissioned Japanese architect Tadao Andao to design the oceanfront compound. The mansions span 40,000 square feet, seven bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, Zillow shows.


Across the country, in the tony Miami enclave
Indian Creek Village
, DJ and producer David Guetta bought a waterfront 1.2 spec estate from developer Todd Glaser for a reported
$69 million
in August. The deal marked the second priciest purchase made by a musician last year. The mansion at 37 Indian Creek Island Drive spans nearly 16,000 square feet, 12 bedrooms, and 118 of bayfront. Guetta’s neighbors on the “Billionaire’s Bunker” island include
Jeff Bezos
,
Tom Brady
and
Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump
.
Following Guetta, Jennifer Lopez and her actor husband Ben Affleck
dropped $60.9 million
on a mansion in Beverly Crest. The 5.2-acre compound at 2571 Wallingford Drive includes a 38,000-square-foot mansion, a 5,000-square-foot guest house, a caretaker’s house and a guard house. The mansion has 12 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, an indoor sports complex with basketball, pickleball and boxing, and collector’s parking for 80 cars.
After JLo’s purchase comes Rick Ross’
$35 million buy
of a Star Island mansion in Miami Beach. Ross closed on the 12,400-square-foot mansion at 37 Star Island Drive in August, after getting approved by the homeowners association. It has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and a Japanese garden.
Other musicians are, however, also looking to sell. Drake listed his Beverly Crest mansion for
$88 million
in May, but has yet to find a buyer. Rod Stewart is
asking $80 million
for a Beverly Park Manor compound. Cher listed her longtime Malibu home for
$75 million

Bel-Air’s Vivenda da Lua, or House of the Moon, went into contract with an asking price of $15.8 million, making it Los Angeles County’s biggest pending sale last week.
The nine-bedroom, eight-bathroom home at 10651 Chalon Road sits in the top spot in the inaugural report for the county from brokerage Eklund-Gomes. Called the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report L.A., the weekly roundup tracks signed contracts of residential properties with prices of $4 million or more. All data is sourced from MLS.
Property records show Vivenda da Lua’s seller is a family trust tied to the late interior designer Erika Brunson, for whom the estate was designed.
Coldwell Banker Realty’s Joyce Rey has the listing for the property, which totals 9,183 square feet. Its design was modeled after a Spanish Portuguese villa.
Highlights of the Bob Ray Offenhauser-designed property include a three-story main house, attached guest suite, pool, gardens, library and Zen room.
The home hit the market in November for just under $20 million before a series of price cuts.
Overall, single-family homes in the county sat on the market for an average of 60 days, with prices averaging $6.9 million, according to the Eklund-Gomes report.
The House of the Moon sits less than two miles from another Bel-Air property, named Villa Del Amor at 10936 Chalon Road, which entered the market last week for $115 million. It’s owned by financiers and
Sugarfina board directors
Paul Kessler and Diana Derycz-Kessler.


The county’s second-largest contract last week is a home once owned by Muhammad Ali. The Hancock Park property at 55 Fremont Place is under contract for $13 million.
Property records show a notice of default sent Feb. 7 on the 10,567-square-foot home. It went to auction in April.
The Beverly Hills Estates’ Stefani Stolper and Kristen Lawson, along with Coldwell Banker’s June Ahn, are the listing agents.
The Fremont Place home was previously listed in 2022 for about $17 million by Michael Lawson, former Los Angeles Urban League CEO, and Mattie McFadden-Lawson.
Across Los Angeles County, a total of 27 single-family home contracts in the $4 million-plus market segment were inked between June 3 and June 9 for $185.5 million in volume, according to the Eklund-Gomes report.
Elsewhere in the country, Miami-Dade County counted 25 home and condo contracts totaling $220.5 million for the same period ended June 9, according to Eklund-Gomes Weekly Luxury Report Miami. The brokerage’s New York report counted 24 properties under contract totaling $193 million, according to a report for the same week from Olshan Realty.
Olshan produces a weekly luxury market report for Manhattan, with Eklund producing a similar roundup for Miami, Austin and now Los Angeles.

Rupert Murdoch won’t be blasting out many headlines about the sale of his Flatiron triplex.
The media scion sold his condominium at One Madison for $23.8 million, Crain’s
reported
. Murdoch was
in contract
to sell the triplex at 23 East 22nd Street in October with a final asking price of $28.5 million.
Selling the penthouse has been a slog for Murdoch. Two years ago, he listed the 7,000-square-foot pad for $62 million. Several reductions followed, including the markdown in June to $28.5 million from $38.5 million. All of the recent listing prices — and the final purchase price — pale in comparison to the $43 million the nonegenarian spent to purchase the pad in 2014.
The final purchase price works out to $3,400 per square foot.
Murdoch bought the five-bedroom apartment along with another three-bedroom unit, spending  a combined $58 million on the two. He sold the smaller unit in October 2022 for $12.5 million.


The condo, which spans the top three floors of the building, features six bathrooms and a corner great room with double-height ceilings. There’s also a 600-square-foot terrace and views of the Hudson and East rivers.
The building, developed by Related Companies and the defunct HFZ Capital, includes a doorman, concierge, fitness center and pool.
Compass’ Kyle Blackmon had the listing. He declined to comment to Crain’s after the sale hit public records. The buyer’s identity could not be discerned from records.
Murdoch is no stranger to taking a hit on the real estate front these days. In September, a months-long pursuit by his REA Group to take over the United Kingdom’s largest real estate portal was soundly
rebuffed
. REA is locked in a rivalry with Andy Florance’s CoStar Group, which has seen barbs and legal filings shot over the bow.

Basketball star Dion Waiters sold his Pinecrest estate for $11.1 million, four years after leaving the Miami Heat for the Lakers. The deal closed at a steep discount from the $18 million he was asking when it hit the market a year ago.
Waiters sold the mansion at 5745 Southwest 94th Street to an LLC named for the address, records show. The true buyer is unknown.
Ashley Velez of Pure Investments had the listing, and Faranak Mehdian of Coldwell Banker Realty brought the buyer.


Waiters was the fourth overall draft pick when he joined the National Basketball League in 2012. He played for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2012 to 2015, then moved to the Oklahoma City Thunder for one year before joining the
Miami Heat
in 2016. He signed with the Lakers in 2020, but was suspended shortly afterward for taking edibles on the team plane and calling out sick to party for his birthday, according to published reports. After a three-year hiatus from basketball, Waiters is reportedly trying to get back into the game, and has possibly signed a deal with the Lakers, according to
NBA.com
.
Waiters bought the Pinecrest mansion for $7.4 million in 2016, property records show. The 13,200-square-foot mansion was built on 2 acres in 2016. The house has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, records show. The property includes a theater, pool and outdoor kitchen, the listing shows.
Waiters listed the estate for $18 million in March of last year, which would have marked a record for
Pinecrest
had it sold for that price. He slashed the asking price multiple times before closing at $11.1 million, Redfin shows.
Billionaire Jorge Mas, majority owner of Inter Miami, set the Pinecrest price record when he sold his 5-acre estate to the village of Pinecrest for
$14 million
in January. That beat the price record set in November, when [solidcore] founder Anne Mahlum bought a Pinecrest mansion for
$11.3 million
, right after a hidden buyer bought a mansion for a record
$11.2 million
in October. Prior to that, the price record was held by David “Big Papi” Ortiz, the baseball All-Star who sold his Pinecrest house for
$10.6 million
in June.

Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick still needs confirmation before becoming Donald Trump’s commerce secretary, but that’s not stopping him from shopping Washington, D.C.’s real estate market.
Lutnick is in contract to purchase 2400 Foxhall Road NW from another prominent name, Fox News anchor Bret Baier, the Wall Street Journal
reported
. The deal is expected to close this week.
Baier and his wife Amy put the French Château-style house up for sale last year, asking $31.9 million. The most recent asking price is $29 million, which would break down to $1,785 per square foot. A sale at that price would break the 17-year-old record for a residential deal in the nation’s capital, a $24 million transaction in Georgetown.
The Baiers paid only $5.4 million for the property in 2018, but spent the intervening years building a 16,000-square-foot home on the one-and-a-half acre property. They spent nearly $25 million on the project.
Features of the home include a marble fountain, a temperature-controlled wine room, a game room, a putting green and an indoor sports court. The four-story home has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms.


Daniel Heider of Sotheby’s International Realty has the
listing
.
Residential brokers in D.C. have
been preparing
for an influx of well-heeled government officials as Trump prepares to return to the presidency next month. While there’s plenty of wheeling and dealing in the nation’s capital every time an administration turns over, the Trump administration brings a new cohort of wealthy industry titans to town.
Lutnick owns a number of homes, including a penthouse on the Upper East Side and an estate in the Hamptons.
The Baiers, meanwhile, moved on to Palm Beach last year,
dropping $37 million
on a non-waterfront house at 125 Wells Road in an off-market deal. Shortly after, they sold a
smaller home
on the island for $13.5 million.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt found a buyer for his Noho penthouse.
The billionaire’s duplex at 25 Bond Street, asking just under $40 million, was the priciest home in Manhattan to enter contract last week, according to Olshan Realty’s weekly report. The apartment spans 6,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.
A shell company tied to Schmidt bought Unit PHW from Wall Street and cryptocurrency executive Michael Daffey for $24.6 million in 2021. The condo underwent a multi-year renovation before it
hit the market
in mid-December, according to a Streeteasy listing, which claims Schmidt never lived in the home.
The property also features wood-burning fireplaces, two terraces, an outdoor kitchen and hot tub. It sits atop the eight-story boutique building developed by Goldman Properties and completed in 2007. Its amenities include a doorman, gym and parking garage.
Compass’ Nick Gavin and Kimberly Pressman had the listing.
Schmidt’s penthouse was one of 29 Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more to land signed contracts in the first full week of February. The total was up from 22 deals inked in the
previous period
.


The second most expensive property to find a buyer was the 49th floor at 111 West 57th Street, with an asking price of $24 million. The apartment, which spans 4,500 square feet, initially asked just under $30 million when it was marketed off floorplans in 2016.
The condo has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, 14-foot ceilings and views overlooking Central Park.
Sotheby’s International’s Nikki Field Team
took over sales
at the 82-story building, rising above the former Steinway &amp; Sons piano store, last summer. Since sales launched in 2018, 37 of the tower’s 60 units have traded, averaging roughly $4,200 per square foot. Its amenities include a fitness center, pool and private dining room.
Of the 29 properties to enter contract, 23 were condos and six were co-ops.
The homes’ combined asking price was $259 million, which works out to an average price of $8.9 million and a median of $6.3 million. The homes on average spent more than 750 days on the market and were discounted 5 percent from the original listing price.

After more than a year on the market and a
series of price cuts
, Alec Baldwin’s Amagansett estate is back on the market with a new star: Alec Baldwin.
Baldwin’s home at 335 Town Lane in the Hamptons town re-listed for $19 million, Behind the Hedges
reported
. The return comes months after it was pulled from the market, most recently asking $22.5 million in September.
The new price came with a two-minute video featuring none other than Baldwin, who can be seen on the nearby beach and pacing the 10-acre property.
“You just can’t get this out here, you can’t buy big pieces of land, especially in Amagansett,” Baldwin says in the video.
The Amityville native purchased the estate in 1995 for $1.7 million.
The estate has since provided room to grow, with two additions constructed in the past three decades bringing the property’s main home to 10,000 square feet. The property is approved for the construction of a separate 10,000-square-foot home, as well as expanding the existing four-bedroom, seven-bathroom house.


Baldwin listed the property in September 2022 for
$29 million
. At the start of last year, he
cut the price
to $25 million, before reducing it again two months later to $22.5 million.
Saunders &amp; Associates’ Scott Bradley and Michael Cinque still share the
listing
.
Baldwin has been busy elsewhere in New York real estate. In 2022, the actor and his wife, Hilaria, sold their lake house upstate for $530,000. He’s also been shopping his
penthouse in Greenwich Village
in Manhattan. Meanwhile, the couple bought a 55-acre farm in Arlington, Vermont, for $1.7 million.

Raghavan, originally from India, is the head of banking and executive vice chair at Citigroup. He previously served as the head of global investment banking at J.P. Morgan and was the chief executive officer of the company’s divisions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The four-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment was featured on Ryan Serhant’s new reality show “Owning Manhattan.” The season finale shows Serhant and one of his agents, Chloe Tucker Caine, negotiating a rental deal for the condo, which rapper Bad Bunny
rented
for $150,000 a month last year. Serhant’s Kristina Paces and Celine Coudert De Besson represented the musician in the rental deal.
The penthouse was asking just under $18 million when it
went into contract
earlier this year, after initially asking $21 million when it was offered off floor plans in 2016.


The home spans roughly 4,500 square feet with another 4,600 square feet of outdoor space, including three terraces and a rooftop with a lap pool. It also features direct elevator access, a library and eat-in kitchen.
Serhant’s Chase Landow had the listing. Douglas Elliman’s Frances Katzen represented the buyer.
Centaur Properties and Greyscale Development Group’s two-building condo complex was designed by Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld, marking his first New York City building. Its amenities include a private driveway,
known for being “paparazzi proof,”
as well as a fitness center, lap pool and yoga studio.
The 36-unit building has notched several million-dollar deals since sales launched in 2015, including Unit 11S, which sold for $7 million in 2022, and Unit 9A, which sold for $8.4 million the same year.
The 11-story condo complex neighbors Related Companies’ development at 520 West 28th Street. Sales at the Zaha Hadid-designed building have come with significant discounts from their initial offering prices, including Unit 32, which sold for
$13.2 million
last year, down from the $25 million listed in the original offering plan.

Lionel Messi was looking for privacy, luxury and space in his hunt for a home in South Florida.
The soccer superstar found it in Bay Colony, a waterfront community in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his wife
paid nearly $11 million
for a mansion at 91 Compass Lane. The neighborhood is one of the few in the area — if not the only — that’s gated with private round-the-clock security, according to brokers.
“Other communities are gated, but they don’t have the 24-hour security,” said Karen Bellows, an agent with Florida Luxurious Properties who is listing a nearby home at 30 South Compass Drive for $8 million. “Some of the other neighborhoods that have some of these high-end homes, they are trying to match the security [of Bay Colony].”
Messi’s 10,500-square-foot mansion, with eight bedrooms and nine and a half bathrooms, includes a 1,600-square-foot primary suite. It sits on a point lot with two docks and a pool. The property’s 170 feet of water frontage and deep water dockage mean Messi will likely be looking for a yacht to rent or purchase — if he doesn’t have one already.
He’s not the first celebrity to call the neighborhood home: The late fast food giants Dave Thomas and Ray Kroc both lived in Bay Colony. But Messi is definitely the biggest.
“Bay Colony was always an understated neighborhood,” said Keyes Company agent Lauren Dekok, who is listing a home in the nearby town of
Sea Ranch Lakes
, where Messi’s longtime teammate
Sergio Busquets
recently bought a home for $8.7 million.
Robert Esposito, director of sales at RelatedISG Realty, said Messi’s purchase will put the area “on the map.”
Messi’s arrival in South Florida created a frenzy this summer, with paparazzi tailing him as he toured homes in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Photos of him grocery shopping went viral. Messi’s deal with the Mas brothers’ Inter Miami Major League Soccer team is valued between $50 million and $60 million. He also received equity in the team and inked revenue sharing agreements with Adidas, Apple and other companies.


Messi, Esposito said, probably chose Fort Lauderdale so his family “could live a more normal, quiet life.” Luxury homes in Broward County are generally less expensive than those in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, but home prices have been on the rise.
“I see [prices] going up further because there is even more demand for these private communities now,” said Chad Carroll, a top broker at Compass who focuses on Fort Lauderdale. Carroll said the Bay Colony neighborhood competes with Sea Ranch Lakes.
Messi and his family are also close to Drive Pink Stadium and Inter Miami’s adjacent training facility in Fort Lauderdale, and the prestigious Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, where his children may be enrolled.
“Obviously you’re close to
the schools
and the stadium, but it offers larger estates” than Sea Ranch Lakes, Carroll added.
Bay Colony is home to about 100 lots, all of which are waterfront. In 2021, author and social media influencer Patrick Bet-David
set a record
in the neighborhood with his $20.4 million purchase of the mansion at 141 Bay Colony Drive.


Just four single-family homes are on the market, ranging from $4 million to nearly $9 million. The other listings are lots and condos.
Hedy Tufo, an agent with Douglas Elliman, also emphasized Bay Colony’s security. She is listing the home she shares with her husband at 40 North Compass Drive, which is the priciest property on the market in Bay Colony, at $9 million.
“They’re very, very tough about who comes in and out,” she said. “If you want to gain access, you either have to speak to the homeowner or have to be on the permanent list. There is no getting in and out. There is no driving around the neighborhood.”
