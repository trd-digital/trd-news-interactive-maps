Garnett sold it partially completed.\nNow, as a two-year-old lawsuit against the buyer winds its way through Los Angeles Superior Court, a new complaint was filed in June against the title and escrow companies involved in the transaction.\nUnder terms of the 2021 sale, buyer Ando Hacopian of Hacopian Design &amp; Development Group agreed to handle Garnett’s closing costs and any prior liens. Meanwhile, Garnett was expected to walk away with $6 million, including $2 million in cash at closing. An LLC managed by Garnett would carry two, $2 million notes. One was secured at 7 percent interest and would sit junior to an $11 million loan provided by Marquee Funding Group.

At the time, it was configured as a multifamily property with a quadraplex and four one-bedroom units.\nSince then, the couple underwent a significant renovation to combine the units into a single-family home sprawling 8,000 square feet, six bedrooms and six bathrooms. As part of the renovation, the two added a high-speed elevator and updates to the home’s facade, including a new stoop.\nThe Roeloffs partnered with Baxt/Ingui Architects to convert the home into a LEED-certified\npassive house\ndesigned to reduce energy consumption and enhance air quality. The home is outfitted with hospital-grade air filters, solar panels and triple-filtration water system.\n“The point was to do a renovation that was more sustainable, highly effective and that didn’t make any compromises,” Shyanne Roeloffs said.\nShe added that the purpose was to reduce construction waste, which included donating appliances and sourcing materials locally. The backyard fence was constructed using some of the home’s original materials as well as recycled wood from the Coney Island boardwalk.\nThe landmarked brownstone, built in 1889, also features a 500-bottle wine cellar, a terrace with an outdoor fireplace, a yoga, dance and entertainment studio and an eat-in kitchen.\n\n\nThe listing describes the home as “\ntriple mint\n,” which means its kitchen, bathroom and overall condition are pristine, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan wrote in Forbes in 2018.\nRoeloffs said the couple invested heavily in the renovation with expectations to stay in the home for years, but they ultimately chose to move to the U.K. to pursue higher education opportunities and to be closer to family.\n“It’s a bit of a shame to have put so much heart and soul into a place,” Roeloffs said.\nThe Roeloffs first listed the home for $19 million in 2016 before pulling it off the market and relisting it for $17.5 million in 2021. The townhouse hit the market again last April with an asking price of $18 million.\nLeslie J. Garfield’s Richard Pretsfelder and Thomas Wexler had the listing.\nRenovated townhouses are the market’s “sweet spot” right now, though there aren’t many of them on the market, according to Pretsfelder.

However, it was listed for $218 million, then reduced to $187.5 million, and is currently under contract.", "Sale Price (int)": null, "Content": "Sitting on the couch in the staged living room of the Tarpon Island estate in Palm Beach, Todd Michael Glaser seemed befuddled.\n“I don’t know why Tarpon hasn’t sold yet,” the spec developer said in February, shaking his head as he mused about the market between calls.\nTarpon is a 21,400-square-foot renovated megamansion, with 11 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, two kitchens, a home office, tennis court, gym, salon and spa, two pools, a hot tub and cold plunge, sitting on a 2.3-acre private island. It has room to fit staff, in-laws, a catering team and more. It should check all the boxes for the typical ultra-rich homebuyer.\nIn 2021, Glaser and his partners, Jim Randall, Scott Robins and Jonathan Fryd, bought the private island for\n$85 million\n. A year later they listed it for\n$218 million\n, with grandiose visions.  “This is a house for Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,” Glaser told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time. After an unsuccessful first season, it returned to the market at the reduced price of $187.5 million.\nGlaser’s luck changed about a month ago, when Tarpon went into contract. The sale is expected to close soon, and it will mark one of the priciest ever in Florida.\nIt also signifies the true start of the region’s busiest season. After a string of record years during the pandemic that were followed by a dropoff in sales, South Florida agents say this season is delayed and inconsistent, but\ndefinitely still better\nthan other top luxury markets. Price cuts are spurring sales, as buyers are expected to jump into the market as summer approaches.\n“We got a late start is really what it comes down to,” said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach. “There’s definitely been some momentum, but it ebbs and flows very oddly.”\nAs price reductions have become more common, the pricing gap between buyers and sellers of ultra-luxury homes in South Florida has narrowed, resulting in a boost in activity at the very high end over the last two-plus months. Each deal creates momentum for the next. But inventory is still wonky, agents say.\nHousing analyst Jonathan Miller said the luxury market is in a “slow grind.” Pricing has fallen, but it’s still up, compared to pre-pandemic. High interest rates and elevated pricing are keeping sales below pandemic highs. And the upcoming election and slow summer season suggest the boost in activity could be short-lived.\nIn Miami Beach and other barrier island markets including Bal Harbour and Indian Creek, 10 luxury single-family home sales closed in the first quarter, up 25 percent from eight sales during the same period of last year, according to the Miller-authored\nDouglas Elliman reports\n. Still, the median price for luxury homes fell 28 percent to just over $13 million. The reports define luxury as the top 10 percent of deals. Inventory and months of supply also rose.\nIn Palm Beach, the overall number of single-family home sales and their median price each rose in the same time period. Isolating the top 10 percent of the market, luxury home and condo sales fell 10 percent to nine closings; and the median price fell 18 percent to $14 million.\n“Part of this decline is attributable to a shift in the mix, in terms of what’s selling. Even though the median price is down, it’s still … higher than pre-pandemic,” Miller said. “The numbers are still elevated, but choppy.”\nMarket movers\nSouth Florida’s major luxury deals were concentrated in Palm Beach and Miami Beach this season, though a handful of sales scattered across South Florida’s waterways are still setting records.\nEven sales of vacant lots have picked up. Those deals are often more challenging because of the cost and time associated with building. Dora Puig, top broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, said teardowns and land sales are being “really negotiated.”\nIn April, billionaire Barry Diller\npaid $45 million\nfor the 1.5-acre waterfront lot at 5930 North Bay Road, a record for the waterfront Miami Beach street. Nearby, an assemblage of waterfront land at 18 La Gorce Circle, asking $132 million, is in contract to two buyers after the price was reduced twice from the original $170 million asking price. Both of those deals include homes that the buyers are expected to tear down and replace with new mansions.\nBuyers are looking at the usual areas: the Sunset and Venetian islands, North Bay Road, La Gorce, Star Island and Indian Creek, said top Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer.\nDiller’s buy and billionaire Teddy Sagi’s pending\n$24 million purchase\nof a teardown at 4521 Pine Tree Drive show that buyers are willing to spend big money on vacant lots again.\n“Two big sales is enough for everyone to be excited,” Goldentayer said.\nIn another private island deal, billionaire Jeff Bezos\ndropped $90 million\non a third waterfront Indian Creek Village estate in March. The Amazon founder had been in the market for a home he could live in while he has a mansion built on a double lot on the island that he assembled last year for nearly $150 million.\nThe activity has spilled over to condos, too. In Surfside, a penthouse at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club\nsold for $44 million\n, a record $6,000 per square foot.\n\n\nGoldentayer sees consistent demand for properties priced at $20 million and up.\n“The demand continues [for] uber-wealthy new residents re-domiciling, and they want something special,” she said.\nBrokers say they’re seeing multiple buyers expressing interest, especially following a price cut, but not necessarily pulling the trigger.\n“In each of those markets, there seems to be a good number of buyers,” said Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, who is representing the seller in the pending La Gorce deal. “That doesn’t mean they’ll overpay.”\nAside from Tarpon Island, big Palm Beach deals include Nvidia board member Harvey Jones’\n$74.3 million purchase\nof a 1-acre lakefront estate, which closed in March. Earlier this month, a hidden buyer\ndropped $85 million\nto acquire Ideavillage founder Anand Khubani’s oceanfront 1-acre lot at 108 El Mirasol.\nThe deals that have closed are spurring more activity, agents say.\n“It churns the soil up underneath, it electrifies things,” said Douglas Elliman’s Chris Leavitt, who is co-listing Tarpon Island. Pricey listings selling can “give the property down the street a little boost.”\nLuxury lurkers\nProspective buyers are keeping a close eye on homes they’re interested in — sometimes by boat. When some such trophy properties go into contract, those who missed out want to be notified if the deal falls through.\nThey’re “a little bit nervous, waiting and hesitating and losing the property they want,” Hertzberg said. “But at the same time we’re not back to [the buying frenzy of] 2021.”\nMiller referred to these buyers as “luxury lurkers.” They want to buy, but feel less urgency.\nPuig said she has a waitlist of nine buyers who want to see her $80 million listing at 4736 North Bay Road, a waterfront estate under construction that developer Niklas de la Motte was building for himself.\nNelson Gonzalez, a top agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said “huge demand” still exists. “It’s just the very high-end buyers thinking the market is going to come down.”\nSome properties are selling at record prices, and some are experiencing price cuts.\nAfter a year on the market\nasking $200 million\n, cosmetics heir William Lauder slashed the price for two oceanfront lots in Palm Beach. Rather than sell them together, he’s now looking for two buyers at $88.9 million each. He also tapped Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate to take over the listing from Premier Estate Properties’ Jim McCann.\nAt the end of the day, the asking price is a test.\n“It’s all over the board. I have denied some listings because of the seller’s desired asking price. I don’t want to waste my time or theirs,” said Elliman agent Samantha Curry. “There’s also some sellers that will say ‘I don’t know where the market is, so let’s try this number.’”\nBrokers expect they’ll have a little more time to find the sweet spot on pricing this season. Given the slow start and recent burst of activity, deals could keep closing past Memorial Day.\n“I anticipate this season trending later this year,” said Premier Estate Properties agent Margit Brandt, who is representing the buyer in the pending Tarpon Island deal. “There’ll be a lot of closings in June and July.”\nEven with the extension, buyers and sellers are still rushing to get deals done before they head to their summer homes.\n“There’s a major push right now,” Leavitt said. “It’s almost like a scurry to purchase before people leave.”", "lat": 26.6936765, "lon": -80.0417076, "image_links": "https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Price-Cuts-Big-Deals-Define-South-Florida-Luxe-Resi-Market_Main-1400x875.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.0417076, 26.6936765 ] } },

His family is now fighting the singer for control of their father’s $15 million estate.\nIn July 2020, the then 80-year-old military veteran with Huntington’s Disease said he had just undergone a six-hour back surgery and had taken opiates to numb the pain.\n“The combination of his age, frailty from his back condition and recent surgery, and the opiates he was taking several times a day rendered Mr. Westcott of unsound mind,” according to a lawsuit.\nThree days after he was released from the hospital, Bernie Gudvi, who represented Perry and Bloom, presented Westcott with a written offer for more than he had paid two months earlier for the eight-bedroom, 11-bath estate, according to his complaint.\nThe following day, Westcott signed a sales agreement prepared by Berkshire Hathaway.\nThe deal, reported at the time for\n$14.2 million\n, included a four-building compound in the Santa Ynez foothills built in the 1930s, then renovated by architect Lutah Maria Riggs. For Perry, born and raised in Santa Barbara, it was supposed to be a homecoming.\n\n\nBut Westcott’s lawyers argue the aging seller was “unable to understand the nature and probable consequences of his actions.” Days later, Westcott “started to feel mentally clear again” and realized the weight of his signature on the agreement, the complaint states.\nWestcott then sent an email to Berkshire Hathaway, which represented the seller and buyer, saying that he didn’t want to sell — that he’d been under the influence of pain medication and was “in the final years of his life and cannot sell his home,” the lawsuit contends.\nTwo days later, the Westcott received a letter from a lawyer for Gudvi, Perry and Bloom, saying the couple was “not willing to walk away from purchasing Mr. Westcott’s home and he is obligated to complete the sale.”\nWestcott, who served in the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division, is an entrepreneur with roots in Texas who owned numerous companies, including 1-800-Flowers.\nPreviously, Perry ran into another legal bramble when she tried to buy an 8-acre Los Angeles convent for a future home.\nThe pop star spent roughly two years\nfighting a group of aging nuns\nand a competing wannabe buyer, restaurateur Dana Hollister, for the former Waverly Place convent at 3431 Waverly Drive.

The tech mogul is splitting up his compound, demolishing one of the houses and replacing it with a modern 6,800-square-foot home, planning documents show. Thiel bought the homes at 441 and 445 East Rivo Alto Drive for\n$18 million\nin 2020 from\nformer Ford CEO Jacques Nasser\n. Since then, Thiel has hosted a number of parties and fundraising bashes for GOP politicians, according to published reports.\nThiel\nand his co-founders sold\nPayPal\nto eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002 and went on to launch the venture capital firm Founders Fund and data analytics giant Palantir Technologies. He was famously Facebook’s first investor, and has advocated for young adults to forgo college and launch companies with his Thiel Fellowship. He has an estimated net worth of $7.2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\nThe aging Venetian Islands compound includes two houses, two pools and 0.6 waterfront acres. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1947, and the 5,500-square-foot house at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1956, according to property records. His approved plans show he intends to split the properties and build a new house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive. The plans do not note his intentions for the adjacent home at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive.\nThe timing for the construction project is convenient. Thiel, a well-known libertarian who backed Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has declined to fund any politicians in the 2024 race –– so no need for fundraising events.\nThiel’s new house will include two offices, a guest bedroom and bathroom, nanny’s quarters with a service entrance and three bedrooms fronting a playroom, the plans show. He and husband Matt Danzeisen share two daughters, according to published reports.\nThe house, designed by Leo Marmol and Rod Radziner’s Los Angeles-based firm Marmol Radziner, will also have a redesigned pool and landscaping.\nSince Thiel bought his compound in 2020, the Venetian Islands have become a South Florida hub for the so-called “PayPal Mafia” and other Silicon Valley giants. Venture capitalist and PayPal alum Keith Rabois, an early bidder on LinkedIn, Square and Yelp, bought a Venetian Islands mansion\nfor $28.9 million\nin 2020. Famed WhatsApp investor Jim Goetz bought a pair of adjacent homes\nfor $29.6 million\nin 2017 and 2019.\nThis month, the\n$22.5 million sale\nof a Venetian Islands house was linked to “PayPal Mafia” member and venture capitalist David Sacks.", "lat": 25.7941925, "lon": -80.1551108, "image_links": "https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Peter-Thiel-Wins-Approval-for-Venetian-Islands-House-Design-m-1400x875.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.1551108, 25.7941925 ] } },

It’s also the buzziest by virtue of the home’s former owner and the treatment of the property by West, who now calls himself Ye. (See accompanying photo slideshow from a walk-through of the property.)\nThe high-profile transaction also brings to light the unusual business model Belwood uses to grow its investment portfolio. At its simplest, the company is a real estate flipper using a fractionalized investing model on its mostly residential and some commercial fix-up projects.\nWhere it gets interesting is the app platform Belwood uses to pool investors. These investors typically account for 20 percent of a property’s acquisition financing. Belwood comes in with the remaining 80 percent, working with its stable of lenders. In the case of Malibu, it arranged financing with CV3 Financial Services, an El Segundo-based provider of bridge, rental and construction loans. Homes are rehabbed or restored and then resold, with the profit split between Belwood and the investors.\nWith Ye’s former home, a total of 500 investors hopped on board to loan anywhere from $1,000 to $1 million.\nIt’s technically not crowdfunding, Belmont explained, with individual investors acting as private lenders on a property. In return, those individuals are trustees until the real estate is sold.\nThe investors, to a certain extent, are part of the decision-making process on property work. Currently, they can leave comments about a project through the app. A new version expected to soon launch will add voting capabilities on certain finishes, such as painting the walls White Sand versus, say, White Linen, Belmont explained.\n“It’s still a white wall, but it gives them the opportunity to help decide,” he said. “It’s the same with the concrete, same for the roof and same for the front door.”\nIn the case of Malibu, Belwood Investments expects to shell out $6 million to $8 million on an estimated 12- to 16-month renovation project.\nWhat works\nMalibu is the latest of Belwood’s expanding Los Angeles market buys.\nThe firm’s local under-construction portfolio includes the late singer-songwriter Bill Withers’ home at 1614 Viewmont Drive in the Hollywood Hills, plus two other Viewmont Drive properties. There are also homes at 1925 and 1855 Loma Vista Drive in Beverly Hills. Belwood also has  2201 Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills and 7610 Woodrow Wilson Drive near Laurel Canyon.\nBelmont said he isn’t set on one price point over another: “I buy properties that are $30 million. I buy properties that are $30,000.”\n\n\nCoastal California, Florida and New York are all markets Belmont considers sustainable domestically.\n“I don’t go to Wyoming. I don’t follow the shiny objects. That’s not my thing because those [markets] are the most heavily impacted when the market shifts,” he noted.\nWhile ensuring a property has good foundational elements that can lead to a quick sale, Belwood also looks for homes that are rentable as a safety net in the event of a market turn.\nThe strategy has largely remained intact since Belwood’s start.\nBelmont, who originally began as a mortgage broker in the early 2000s, saw his mentors successfully flip homes during the subprime mortgage meltdown. He bought his first property in Antelope, north of Sacramento at 3052 Scotland Drive for $175,000. He handled all the work to educate himself on the process and pricing. He sold it for $350,000 three months later.\nHe flipped another two homes on his own before friends took note. They liked the idea of flipping but didn’t want to do it full-time or put their retirement savings on the line. Belmont offered to handle half the purchase price, while his friends came up with the other half and they split the profits.\nThat process later opened up beyond Belmont’s friends in what officially became Belwood, utilizing the app to keep investors informed of projects’ progress.\n“I designed it to be the anti-BlackRock or the anti-Blackstone,” Belmont said. “This was designed to create a financial impact not only to the local investor but to the community.”\nEyeing DTLA office\nThe company, which has corporate offices in Folsom, more recently opened a Newport Beach location and is now working on an Athens, Greece outpost.\nThe overseas strategy eyes properties in tourist areas as short-term rentals. The goal, unlike domestically, isn’t to venture into suburban areas, Belmont said.\nFarther out, the 80/20 split in funding acquisitions is likely to shift. Belmont projected the firm will eventually move to cover 90 percent of a deal.\nIn the commercial space, Belwood expects next week to complete work on a golf course, set to be called Belmont Pines Golf Course north of Santa Rosa. There’s also an RV park and a Calistoga motel.\nBelmont said flex space that can lead to conversions, or a mix of uses, are the focus near term.\nHe acknowledged the more he delves into commercial, the greater the complexities are in working with state and local governments. Still, he said he’s sitting on the sidelines, eyeing Downtown Los Angeles’ challenged office market in particular.\n“I’ve had my eyes on the big, tall buildings with the graffiti all over them,” Belmont said without naming Oceanwide Plaza. “I would love to take that on. That’s kind of a lofty goal.”", "lat": 34.0316804, "lon": -118.716669, "image_links": "https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_8363.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -118.716669, 34.0316804 ] } },

The case was continued until July 25. Chung and attorneys for the Buljans and Sadeghi did not respond to requests for comment. Fei and Gable declined to comment.\nThe pending litigation has not stopped the 1.3-acre, seemingly completed property from coming to market with a nearly $55 million dollar price tag.\nCompass agents Mary and Brent Gullixson have the listing and declined to comment on the suits or the property.\nThe listing website for the property describes “just completed extraordinary new construction” centered around a main residence with 14,700 square feet, including a two-car garage.\nIt has eight bedrooms, 10 full baths, three half-baths, a home theater and fitness center, and 11-foot ceilings on the main and lower levels.\nThe amenities are also plentiful: a two-car detached garage and a two-car carport, all wired for electric vehicle charging; a poolside cabana with a fireplace and bathroom; a saltwater pool with spa and glass wall; a tennis/pickleball court; and a fruit and vegetable garden.\nA failed escrow\n\n\nSadeghi bought the property from its long-time owners for $8.1 million in 2016 through Linda Flora Holdings LLC, according to public records.\nIn 2018, he filed permits to demolish the existing property and build a new one, which he estimated would cost about $4.7 million for the main residence, according to city permits.\nThe Yuans, through an LLC named Marigoldyzp, signed on to buy the property in early 2021, putting down a $1.1 million deposit, court documents show. To fund the construction, Marigoldyzp signed onto a $28.4 million loan.\nIn March 2022, Atherton issued a Stop Notice because the construction was not yet complete and had gone beyond the allowable time line for the 2018 permit.\nIn order to get the project going again, Sadeghi asked the Buljans in October 2022 to guarantee the $2.5 million loan, which contained a stipulation that work had to be completed by April 30, 2023.\nThe Yuans also made several smaller additional payments to Sadeghi for construction, according to the complaint, but balked when he asked for an additional $8.14 million in July of 2023 to complete the project and pay for ongoing costs.\nSadeghi “knowingly participated in a scheme that he knew would result in harm” to Yuans’ LLC, “in order to obtain a continual flow of liquidity he could access to pay personal and business expenses,” according to the suit.\nWhen Marigoldyzp refused to hand over more to finish construction, Sadeghi allegedly stopped construction and refused to close escrow.\nIn an email to agent Ron Gable explaining the need for the additional millions, Sadeghi argued that the $8.14 million simply covered carrying costs including mortgages, debt costs, property taxes, insurance and utilities since the Yuans entered into contract on the home in 2021, court records show.\n“It has cost millions of dollars a year simply to keep the lights on at 88 [Tuscaloosa] and it’s not fair for me to get buried and lose my health as a result,” Sadeghi said in the email.\nHe added that “Covid, a lengthy payment process, hundreds of changes and meetings, and other unforeseen factors have caused construction to stop and start over and over again.”\nHe closed out his request by saying, “We need an outcome where BOTH sides can walk away healthy, safe and with their shirt on their back. As it stands now, I can’t afford to close this deal and this process has stretched me out to the point that it is literally killing me.”\n\n\nThe Buljans countersuit also paints a similar picture, one where the Yuans’ “significant changes” drove up both the costs and timeline of the project.\nThe Yuans allegedly strung Sadeghi along by promising him “various extrinsic business deals, including other real estate development, to induce him to continue work on the property,” the countersuit said.\n“Ali Sadeghi was willing to continue incurring these costs because Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan were continually promising him that he would be able to make money in other ways outside the transaction through developing a personal and business relationship with Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan,” it went on. “All this time no party sought to close the escrow on the purchase of the property.”", "lat": 37.4580448, "lon": -122.2070203, "image_links": "https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SFO-Gap-co-founder-Doris-Fisher-sells-six-acre-Atherton-estate-for-almost-48M-FEATUREIMG_v2-150x106.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -122.2070203, 37.4580448 ] } },

The neighborhood is one of the few in the area — if not the only — that’s gated with private round-the-clock security, according to brokers.\n“Other communities are gated, but they don’t have the 24-hour security,” said Karen Bellows, an agent with Florida Luxurious Properties who is listing a nearby home at 30 South Compass Drive for $8 million. “Some of the other neighborhoods that have some of these high-end homes, they are trying to match the security [of Bay Colony].”\nMessi’s 10,500-square-foot mansion, with eight bedrooms and nine and a half bathrooms, includes a 1,600-square-foot primary suite. It sits on a point lot with two docks and a pool. The property’s 170 feet of water frontage and deep water dockage mean Messi will likely be looking for a yacht to rent or purchase — if he doesn’t have one already.\nHe’s not the first celebrity to call the neighborhood home: The late fast food giants Dave Thomas and Ray Kroc both lived in Bay Colony. But Messi is definitely the biggest.\n“Bay Colony was always an understated neighborhood,” said Keyes Company agent Lauren Dekok, who is listing a home in the nearby town of\nSea Ranch Lakes\n, where Messi’s longtime teammate\nSergio Busquets\nrecently bought a home for $8.7 million.\nRobert Esposito, director of sales at RelatedISG Realty, said Messi’s purchase will put the area “on the map.”\nMessi’s arrival in South Florida created a frenzy this summer, with paparazzi tailing him as he toured homes in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Photos of him grocery shopping went viral. Messi’s deal with the Mas brothers’ Inter Miami Major League Soccer team is valued between $50 million and $60 million. He also received equity in the team and inked revenue sharing agreements with Adidas, Apple and other companies.\n\n\nMessi, Esposito said, probably chose Fort Lauderdale so his family “could live a more normal, quiet life.” Luxury homes in Broward County are generally less expensive than those in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, but home prices have been on the rise.\n“I see [prices] going up further because there is even more demand for these private communities now,” said Chad Carroll, a top broker at Compass who focuses on Fort Lauderdale. Carroll said the Bay Colony neighborhood competes with Sea Ranch Lakes.\nMessi and his family are also close to Drive Pink Stadium and Inter Miami’s adjacent training facility in Fort Lauderdale, and the prestigious Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, where his children may be enrolled.\n“Obviously you’re close to\nthe schools\nand the stadium, but it offers larger estates” than Sea Ranch Lakes, Carroll added.\nBay Colony is home to about 100 lots, all of which are waterfront. In 2021, author and social media influencer Patrick Bet-David\nset a record\nin the neighborhood with his $20.4 million purchase of the mansion at 141 Bay Colony Drive.\n\n\nJust four single-family homes are on the market, ranging from $4 million to nearly $9 million. The other listings are lots and condos.\nHedy Tufo, an agent with Douglas Elliman, also emphasized Bay Colony’s security. She is listing the home she shares with her husband at 40 North Compass Drive, which is the priciest property on the market in Bay Colony, at $9 million.\n“They’re very, very tough about who comes in and out,” she said. “If you want to gain access, you either have to speak to the homeowner or have to be on the permanent list. There is no getting in and out. There is no driving around the neighborhood.”", "lat": 26.2050273, "lon": -80.1020415, "image_links": "https://static.therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/main_MIA_Messi-Bay-Colony-1400x875.jpg" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.1020415, 26.2050273 ] } }
