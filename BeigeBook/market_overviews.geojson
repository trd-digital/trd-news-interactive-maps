Related in particular is betting big on Broward, with seven condo projects stretching from Hollywood to Hillsboro Beach. </p><p>Brickell and West Palm Beach are buzzier, better-known centers of South Florida’s real estate boom, but Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach have caught the attention of developers, who pitch the county as a more affordable, relaxed alternative to Miami-Dade for local and out-of-state buyers alike. There’s room to grow, especially with hospitality brands that can elevate the area with luxury buyers. </p><p>Developers and agents say Broward’s growth wouldn’t be possible without the pandemic catalyzing the market — and saturating Miami’s. Many of Broward’s buyers are Miami price refugees, fleeing the global megawealth warping the city’s cost of living. </p><p>“People who are looking for second homes or to invest in real estate also have budgets,” Pérez said. “As people get priced out of Miami, they’re looking at other options.”</p><p>However, since President Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2 and the pause just one week later, developers, contractors and lenders in South Florida have been mapping out different scenarios — preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best, said developer Gaetano Caltagirone of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://therealdeal.com/tag/calta-group/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747777969043755&amp;usg=AOvVaw1y7-lXGjoN-vAPhaTsdzU9\">Calta Group</a>. </p><p>Developers, universal in their desire to keep moving, agree that uncertainty is the killer.

Some developers say the projects that will be affected most by tariffs are those that are about to break ground or just broke ground. </p><p>Other developers are much <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://therealdeal.com/national/2025/04/10/real-estate-leaders-says-tariffs-will-not-cause-much-pain/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747777969045952&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vwNl_xlAYqC38C1E8MC7H\">more bullish</a>. </p><p>Henry Torres, who recently priced out the cost to build a rental project in Miami called Havana Enclave, where construction could begin this summer, said he’s been able to convince his subcontractors that the tariffs “aren’t going to have a very big impact on us.” None of the bigger subcontractors he’s working with are including price escalations in their contracts, Torres said.</p><p>Commercial - office leasing </p><p>Class A demand in Miami’s Brickell and West Palm Beach propped up South Florida’s office market in the first quarter.</p><p>Landlords experienced positive signs, such as rising average asking rents, and vacancy rates ticked down even as the tri-county region experienced a glut of new inventory, a JLL report shows.

In the first quarter, developers built roughly the same amount of new space, 389,940 square feet, as in the first three months of last year, when they added 353,790 square feet of new space.</p><p>In Palm Beach County,, the vacancy rate jumped to 14 percent in the first quarter, compared to 12.4 percent during the same period of last year.

Philly itself is the second most populous city in the Northeast, after NYC, with 1.6 million people living within city limits. Politics: Philly is a generally blue city with some purple spots. The suburbs are more mixed, getting redder the further out you go. The mayor, Jim Kenney, is a Dem, as are 13/17 City Council members (plus 2 Republicans and 1 Working Families Party members). History: The city was founded by history’s most famous Quaker, William Penn, in 1682 and remains loyal to him. He master planned the city’s grid of one-way streets interspersed with parks, and until 1987, no one built anything higher than the statue of him on top of City Hall out of respect. (Philadelphians then blamed our sports teams’ poor performance on this, calling it the “Curse of Billy Penn.” Broken in 2008.) Nowadays the city’s economy is driven mostly by financial services, healthcare, bio and information technology, and a few others. Comcast, Aramark, and Urban Outfitters are all based there. Everyone works in the city, and there’s a big commuter pipeline of folks who live in the suburbs – this is what gave the Main Line, a string of ritzy suburbs, its life. (FTR I am from the Main Line. Unfortunately.) Priciest neighborhoods: Within city limits, the fanciest nabes with the priciest homes are Society Hill (obvious), Rittenhouse Square (Delancey Street in particular – that’s your status street), Fitler Square, and Chestnut Hill, which feels like a separate town but is technically still a Philly ZIP code. Neighborhoods like Fishtown, Queen Village, and Northern Liberties are your fast-gentrifying spots – not as fancy yet, but full of young people and lots of cranes. Outside of the city, it’s all Main Line towns, starting (closest to the city) in Merion and ending (further) in Malvern. Closer in, though, you are starting to see a lot of construction in places like Conshohocken and Manayunk, on the other side of the river from the Main Line. People in Philly go “down the shore” to the beaches of South Jersey – the fancy towns there are Avalon and Stone Harbor. People also do care about what happens in Atlantic City. More so than they care about what happens in Camden.<p></p><p>Last Updated: May 7, 2025</p>", "Last Updated": "May 12, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -75.1652215, 39.9525839 ] } },

History: founded in the 1830’s thanks to the Western &amp; Atlantic railroad, which links Savannah (then a hugely important port) to the Midwest. It grew fast after this and became an important distribution hub during the Civil War, and then became the state capital during the Reconstruction. It was the center of the “New South,” with a modern economic system (vs the earlier, more rural economy most of the state had at the end of the 19th century) and an educational center, with Georgia Tech plus a large consortium of HBCUs. It continued to grow as a manufacturing hub during the World Wars, and was a major center for the Civil Rights Movement.

Today its economy is highly corporate, with the HQs for Coca-Cola, Home Depot, Delta, Mercedes-Benz, UPS, and more. It’s a huge broadcasting hub, home to the world’s busiest airport, and has become a big center for film and television. Priciest neighborhoods: Most of the fanciest neighborhoods, like Tuxedo Park, Chastain Park, and Argonne Forest, are in the Buckhead area, on the northern side of ATL. Buckhead has been called the Beverly Hills of the South. There are also upscale neighborhoods further east, like Decatur and Druid Hills. A little further west, there are some fancy estates along the Chattahoochee River, and more and more luxury condos have popped up, from Buckhead to Midtown.<p></p><p>Last Updated: May 17, 2025</p>", "Last Updated": "May 12, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -84.3885209, 33.7501275 ] } },

History: Orlando is really the heart of Central Florida. It was settled initially in the 1850’s and became the heart of the nation’s citrus production in the 1870s, but lots of that was killed off by a big freeze in 1894. It’s long been a popular resort area, and had an Army base that was important in World War II, but of course the real boost for the area came in 1965, when Walt Disney World was announced. The population surged 129% in the ‘60s. Disney World opened in 1971, followed by SeaWorld in 1973. Universal Orlando opened in 1990. So while there is still some citrus production, an Air Force base, and a good core of military defense and aerospace companies in the area (including Lockheed Martin), tourism is hugely important for the economy. The University of Central Florida has also greatly expanded, and there’s a large research park, the seventh largest in the country. It’s been among the fastest growing cities in the country for the last several years. And significantly, it’s inland, away from the coast, with a lessened threat from hurricanes and sea level rise. Priciest neighborhoods: Gated communities are big here. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/golden-oak-florida-disney-f84ad99a&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747777976733437&amp;usg=AOvVaw33eSZAypncthGif2ELu_MA\">Golden Oak</a>, the only residential community within Disney World, made headlines earlier this year. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lakenona.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747777976733594&amp;usg=AOvVaw15i1WXjqpbQHliLt_mtyGN\">Lake Nona</a> has a number of professional golf and tennis players.

That said, the current mayor, Vi Lyles, is a Democrat, and the 11-person city council (with seven district members and four at-large members) is 9-to-2 Democrats to Republicans. Because of the system, there’s also a city manager who’s responsible for carrying out the things that the council and the mayor enact. History: Charlotte is called the Queen City after Queen Charlotte, who was queen of England in the 1760s when the city was being settled. Early settlers were largely Presbyterian, and religion has an important part in the city’s growth – it’s the “city of churches” and was home to the likes of Billy Graham and Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker. It boomed in the late 19th and early 20th century after the railroad between Atlanta and DC came to town, and boomed again in the 1970’s and ‘80s after the North Carolina National Bank became Bank of America. Wachovia was also based here before it was acquired by Wells Fargo; Charlotte today is very much a banking city. In the city, in fact, there are tunnels between the skyscrapers so bankers can travel to meetings with each other – without having to go outside. (For many years Charlotte’s center city, “Uptown”, was not considered super nice. It has become safer, cleaner, and popular in recent years.) Priciest neighborhoods: Eastover and Myers Park and the fanciest neighborhoods. These are the old money areas with the big, tree-lined streets. There are nice neighborhoods around them too, like Foxcroft, Barclay Downs (where reporter Keith Larsen grew up), <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/charlotte-north-carolinas-priciest-home-selling-for-8-75-million-7bd8f9f3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747777977388332&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xhsHb4VlDzMAoH4hhUpSb\">Quail Hollow</a> and SouthPark. Up-and-coming neighborhoods with lots of young people and lots of construction include Uptown (which is downtown…), Plaza Midwood, NoDa, and South End. There are also pricey communities around Lake Norman, and Charlotte people will go up to the mountains around Asheville and out to the coast to high-end spots like Wilmington, the Outer Banks, and other beach towns.<p></p><p>Last Updated: May 8, 2025</p>", "Last Updated": "May 12, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.840116, 35.2215548 ] } },

There’s also a popularly elected vice mayor who presides over the council, but only votes to break ties. Council members are only part-time legislators, paid about $23K annually. History: Nashville was established as a fort in the late 18th century, and became important because it’s along the Cumberland River, which is a tributary to the Ohio. Its population grew dramatically though the 19th century, and it became the Tennessee state capital in 1843. It was an early center for the iron business, with ore deposits across the region, and an important railroad center. The city was a lot of suburbanization after WWII, and to maintain its tax base it annexed 42 square miles of suburbs in the early 1960’s. It also saw a big boom in the 1990s thanks to a pro-urban renewal mayor who built and renovated a large number of city landmarks. Today it has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, with a big influx of white collar jobs. Healthcare is the largest industry, but there’s been growth in the auto industry, plus large offices for several top accounting and consulting firms like EY and Deloitte. Wealth manager Alliance Berstein announced that they would move their HQ there by 2024, and Oracle is building a $1.2B campus there. And of course, it’s one of the largest music centers in the world, and has a huge number of universities, including Vanderbilt.

History: Modern Denver came to be in the 1858 Rocky Mountain gold rush, as settlers took over areas that had been set aside as Cheyanne and Arapaho treaty lands. It was a frontier town and a trading and transit hub. A railroad terminus greatly increased the city’s size and prosperity in the late 19th century; it remains the largest city within 500 miles, so it’s an important center for the western plains region and the Front Range. Energy and mining are still important parts of the economy here (in fact, the area was a hub for nuclear energy in the 1960’s, and a waste storage facility contaminated parts of Denver, particularly in the northwestern corner, which remains a problem today), along with government and defense, among other things. Apartment corporation AIMCO is based here, as are a number of fast-casual restaurant groups. Priciest neighborhoods: In Denver, neighborhoods like Cherry Creek, Belcaro, Country Club and Cherry Hills are going to have your priciest listings. There’s a Four Seasons in Downtown Denver now too. But perhaps the most interesting homes will be a (short) flight away, in ritzy ski towns like Aspen, Breckenridge, Vail, and Telluride.<p></p><p>Last Updated: May 9, 2025</p>", "Last Updated": "May 12, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -104.990251, 39.7392358 ] } },

The current mayor, Carolyn Goodman, is an independent, and the council is four-two Dem-Rep. It’s worth noting that a big chunk of the people who live around Vegas live in unincorporated areas, most of which are governed by Clark County. History: Las Vegas was a total backwater until the 1930s, despite activity in the area from both early pioneers and Mormon settlers. It was officially founded in 1905 as a stopping point for the Union Pacific railroad but didn’t take off until 1931 when, in the same year, construction started on the Hoover Dam and Nevada legalized gambling and instituted more flexible divorce laws. The first casino popped up that year, though the first ones on the Strip wouldn’t materialize until the early 1940’s. The town started to gain notoriety for its nightlife after World War II and attracted attention and investment from organized crime figures like Bugsy Siegel. The population boomed through the 1950’s and ‘60s. The ‘60s and ‘70s saw the opening of some of the most famous resorts, like Caesar’s and the original MGM. The ‘80s saw the first mega-resort, the Mirage, which marked the transition into a wider range of entertainment in Vegas, including live music, shows, art, and food in addition to gaming. When the Bellagio opened in the 1990s it was the most expensive hotel in the world, having cost $1.7 billion. Tourism, gaming, and conventions are the town’s main economic drivers. Priciest neighborhoods: Even the highest rollers don’t live on the Strip. Vegas’ wealthiest residents head for gated communities in nearby Summerlin, like The Ridges and Summit Club, or in areas of Henderson like MacDonald Highlands and Southern Highlands.<p></p><p>Last Updated: May 9, 2025</p>", "Last Updated": "May 12, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -115.1391009, 36.171563 ] } }
