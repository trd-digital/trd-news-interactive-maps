At $4,625 for a brokered apartment, the median rent in the borough rose 7.6 percent from last June, according to the monthly report from appraiser Jonathan Miller for Douglas Elliman.</p><p>One new factor at play is the FARE Act, a city law that makes landlords, not renters, pay commission for rental brokers they hire. That’s likely resulted in higher monthly prices, Miller said, as owners try to recoup the new expense. Using some back-of-the-envelope math, he estimates the law has pushed rents up by 1 percent monthly, meaning about 12 percent annually. That tracks with recouping a fee that is typically 10 to 15 percent of annual rent.</p><p>DEVELOPMENT</p><p>The top builders in New York City are building <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://therealdeal.com/data/new-york/2025/nyc-top-builders-see-projects-shrink/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757315091903062&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dCt4ncMj7FFoZ2m_9f8P_\" target=\"_blank\">fewer and smaller projects</a>.</p><p>That’s according to analysis by The Real Deal of building permits issued in the Big Apple where the applicant is a general contractor between March 1, 2024 and March 1, 2025.</p><p>The top five builders — Monadnock Construction, Leeding Builders Group, Suffolk Construction, Aecom Tishman and Lendlease — remained the same year over year, though their places in the ranking shuffled.</p><p>The total estimated square footage of the projects greenlit by the city for these top companies came in at 19.3 million square feet in 2025.

Now it’s overwhelmingly Democratic, with a Dem mayor and 11 Dem city council members out of 13. And the other two are independents. There are also 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions that make recommendations on local issues. \nHistory: DC was built for the political purpose and serves it. It was founded to be the seat of government in 1800 and, since the Organic Act of 1801, has been uniquely under the control of the federal government it was built for.

Philly itself is the second most populous city in the Northeast, after NYC, with 1.6 million people living within city limits. \nPolitics: Philly is a generally blue city with some purple spots. The suburbs are more mixed, getting redder the further out you go. The mayor, Cherelle Parker, is a Dem, as are 14/17 City Council members (plus 1 Republican and 2 Working Families Party members). \nHistory: The city was founded by history’s most famous Quaker, William Penn, in 1682 and remains loyal to him. He master planned the city’s grid of one-way streets interspersed with parks, and until 1987, no one built anything higher than the statue of him on top of City Hall out of respect. (Philadelphians then blamed our sports teams’ poor performance on this, calling it the “Curse of Billy Penn.” Broken in 2008.) Nowadays the city’s economy is driven mostly by financial services, healthcare, bio and information technology, and a few others. Comcast, Aramark, and Urban Outfitters are all based there. Everyone works in the city, and there’s a big commuter pipeline of folks who live in the suburbs – this is what gave the Main Line, a string of ritzy suburbs, its life. (FTR I am from the Main Line. Unfortunately.) \nPriciest neighborhoods: Within city limits, the fanciest nabes with the priciest homes are Society Hill (obvious), Rittenhouse Square (Delancey Street in particular – that’s your status street), Fitler Square, and Chestnut Hill, which feels like a separate town but is technically still a Philly ZIP code. Neighborhoods like Fishtown, Queen Village, and Northern Liberties are your fast-gentrifying spots – not as fancy yet, but full of young people and lots of cranes. Outside of the city, it’s all Main Line towns, starting (closest to the city) in Merion and ending (further) in Malvern. Closer in, though, you are starting to see a lot of construction in places like Conshohocken and Manayunk, on the other side of the river from the Main Line. People in Philly go “down the shore” to the beaches of South Jersey – the fancy towns there are Avalon and Stone Harbor. People also do care about what happens in Atlantic City. More so than they care about what happens in Camden.", "Last Updated": "August 14, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -75.1652215, 39.9525839 ] } },

It was settled initially in the 1850’s and became the heart of the nation’s citrus production in the 1870s, but lots of that was killed off by a big freeze in 1894. It’s long been a popular resort area, and had an Army base that was important in World War II, but of course the real boost for the area came in 1965, when Walt Disney World was announced. The population surged 129% in the ‘60s. Disney World opened in 1971, followed by SeaWorld in 1973. Universal Orlando opened in 1990. So while there is still some citrus production, an Air Force base, and a good core of military defense and aerospace companies in the area (including Lockheed Martin), tourism is hugely important for the economy. The University of Central Florida has also greatly expanded, and there’s a large research park, the seventh largest in the country. It’s been among the fastest growing cities in the country for the last several years. And significantly, it’s inland, away from the coast, with a lessened threat from hurricanes and sea level rise. \nPriciest neighborhoods: Gated communities are big here. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/golden-oak-florida-disney-f84ad99a&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757315101762656&amp;usg=AOvVaw1AJctVBzxnIA6e8Mlun09c\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Oak</a>, the only residential community within Disney World, made headlines earlier this year. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lakenona.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757315101762875&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eMKu5a3Wk11HRWrKX2pe6\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Nona</a> has a number of professional golf and tennis players.

That said, the current mayor, Vi Lyles, is a Democrat, and the 11-person city council (with seven district members and four at-large members) is 9-to-2 Democrats to Republicans. Because of the system, there’s also a city manager who’s responsible for carrying out the mandates that the council and the mayor enact. \nHistory: Charlotte is called the Queen City after Queen Charlotte, who was queen of England in the 1760s when the city was being settled. Early settlers were largely Presbyterian, and religion has an important part in the city’s growth – it’s the “city of churches” and was home to the likes of Billy Graham and Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker. It boomed in the late 19th and early 20th century after the railroad between Atlanta and DC came to town, and boomed again in the 1970s and ‘80s after the North Carolina National Bank became Bank of America. Wachovia was also based here before it was acquired by Wells Fargo; Charlotte today is very much a banking city. In the city, in fact, there are tunnels between the skyscrapers so bankers can travel to meetings with each other – without having to go outside. (For many years Charlotte’s center city, “Uptown”, was not considered super nice. It has become safer, cleaner, and popular in recent years.) \nPriciest neighborhoods: Eastover and Myers Park and the fanciest neighborhoods. These are the old money areas with the big, tree-lined streets. There are nice neighborhoods around them too, like Foxcroft, Barclay Downs (where reporter Keith Larsen grew up), <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/charlotte-north-carolinas-priciest-home-selling-for-8-75-million-7bd8f9f3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757315102517814&amp;usg=AOvVaw2IzxU_mLuvaP3tPVyhT4kD\" target=\"_blank\">Quail Hollow</a> and SouthPark.

There’s also a popularly elected vice mayor who presides over the council, but only votes to break ties. Council members are only part-time legislators, paid about $23K annually. \nHistory: Nashville was established as a fort in the late 18th century, and became important because it’s along the Cumberland River, which is a tributary to the Ohio. Its population grew dramatically though the 19th century, and it became the Tennessee state capital in 1843. It was an early center for the iron business, with ore deposits across the region, and an important railroad center. The city was a lot of suburbanization after WWII, and to maintain its tax base it annexed 42 square miles of suburbs in the early 1960s. It also saw a big boom in the 1990s thanks to a pro-urban renewal mayor who built and renovated a large number of city landmarks. Today it has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, with a big influx of white collar jobs. Healthcare is the largest industry, but there’s been growth in the auto industry, plus large offices for several top accounting and consulting firms like EY and Deloitte. Wealth manager Alliance Bernstein announced that they would move their HQ there by 2024, and Oracle is building a $1.2B campus there. And of course, it’s one of the largest music centers in the world, and has a huge number of universities, including Vanderbilt. \nPriciest neighborhoods: Nashville’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/homes/2023/06/21/65m-leipers-fork-farm-could-break-tennessee-real-estate-record-with-art-party-barn-horses-pool/70338473007/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757315103450826&amp;usg=AOvVaw2LdeYruW4-qU2NtlfDVCqN\" target=\"_blank\">priciest home ever</a> listed this summer, but it’s further afield than most listings.

It was a frontier town and a trading and transit hub. A railroad terminus greatly increased the city’s size and prosperity in the late 19th century; it remains the largest city within 500 miles, so it’s an important center for the western plains region and the Front Range. Energy and mining are still important parts of the economy here (in fact, the area was a hub for nuclear energy in the 1960s, and a waste storage facility contaminated parts of Denver, particularly in the northwestern corner, which remains a problem today), along with government and defense, among other things. Apartment corporation AIMCO is based here, as are a number of fast-casual restaurant groups. \nPriciest neighborhoods: In Denver, neighborhoods like Cherry Creek, Belcaro, Country Club and Cherry Hills are going to have your priciest listings.

The current mayor, Shelley Berkley, is a Democrat. It’s worth noting that a big chunk of the people who live around Vegas live in unincorporated areas, most of which are governed by Clark County. \nHistory: Las Vegas was a total backwater until the 1930s, despite activity in the area from both early pioneers and Mormon settlers. It was officially founded in 1905 as a stopping point for the Union Pacific railroad but didn’t take off until 1931 when, in the same year, construction started on the Hoover Dam and Nevada legalized gambling and instituted more flexible divorce laws. The first casino popped up that year, though the first ones on the Strip wouldn’t materialize until the early 1940’s. The town started to gain notoriety for its nightlife after World War II and attracted attention and investment from organized crime figures like Bugsy Siegel. The population boomed through the 1950s and ‘60s. The ‘60s and ‘70s saw the opening of some of the most famous resorts, like Caesar’s and the original MGM. The ‘80s saw the first mega-resort, the Mirage, which marked the transition into a wider range of entertainment in Vegas, including live music, shows, art, and food in addition to gaming. When the Bellagio opened in the 1990s it was the most expensive hotel in the world, having cost $1.7 billion. Tourism, gaming, and conventions are the town’s main economic drivers. \nPriciest neighborhoods: Even the highest rollers don’t live on the Strip. Vegas’ wealthiest residents head for gated communities in nearby Summerlin, like The Ridges and Summit Club, or in areas of Henderson like MacDonald Highlands and Southern Highlands.", "Last Updated": "August 21, 2025", "Last Updated By": "Mary Diduch" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -115.1391009, 36.171563 ] } }
