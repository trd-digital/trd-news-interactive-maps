The former home of slain Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace is one of the most photographed mansions in the country. It was converted into a luxury boutique hotel with a restaurant, spa, pool, lounge and event space.\n\u201cI feel blessed to be a part of such an important piece of real estate,\u201d Mayweather said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n. \u201cEli Gindi and the\nNakash\nfamily are real estate royalty.\u201d\nGindi said Villa Casa Casuarina, which he called \u201cone of the most iconic properties,\u201d was on the market for $150 million. With Mayweather, the owners plan to open up the estate to the public.\nThe Nakash family, which has built a global conglomerate that started with their fashion brand Jordache Jeans,\nowns at least six hotels\non Ocean Drive.\nVilla Casa Casuarina is a three-story, 23,462-square-foot building that sits on a 0.4-acre property. It was built in 1930. The Nakash family\u2019s Jordache Enterprises paid $41.5 million for the famed site at an auction in 2013.\n\nAyal Frist of AlphaTech Real Estate Group is brokering the deal, and Morris Missry of the New York-based law firm Wachtel Missry is representing Mayweather.\nIt\u2019s expected to close in the first quarter of next year.\nMayweather, who has reportedly\nearned $1.1 billion\nthrough his boxing career and business ventures, recently sold his waterfront Miami Beach mansion on Palm Island\nfor $22 million\n. Last month, he listed his Las Vegas mansion for $12.5 million, the Las Vegas Review-Journal\nreported\n.\nBut he has been ramping up his commercial real estate investment.

        "content": "The Hamptons is the historic hotspot on Long Island for celebrity buyers. Dwyane Wade and wife Gabrielle Union, however, are bringing the heat to its alter-ego.\nThe former NBA star and the actress paid $2.6 million for a home in Jamesport on the North Fork, the New York Post\nreported\n. The East End beach house has been featured in magazines, including Domino and Dwell. Its half-acre footprint includes a private beach on the Long Island Sound.\nThe price for the 3,500-square-foot abode breaks down to $743 per square foot.\nThe sellers are Stuart Elliott, the CEO and editor-in-chief of\nThe Real Deal\n, and his wife Julie Satow, a bestselling author and former real estate reporter. They declined to comment.\nElliott and Satow purchased a 1940s cottage on the site as a teardown eight years ago for $600,000 and built a house with custom designs and interiors, such as high ceilings, an open floor plan and glass windows.\nThe home, in the Town of Riverhead, has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a guest room. The primary bedroom suite has a private balcony and office nook. The house also has an expansive basement, screened porch, waterfront deck, outdoor shower and hot tub.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Sheri Winter Parker had the whisper listing.\nWade is an institution in Miami \u2014 and was recently\nhonored with a statue\noutside the arena of his former team, the Miami Heat \u2014 but has recently been making inroads elsewhere. He and Union moved their home base to Los Angeles and Wade has become a minority owner of the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.\nIn 2021, Wade and Union sold their waterfront Miami Beach mansion for\n$22 million\n, more than $10 million off the original asking price from two years earlier.\nTheir newest home is pricey by North Fork standards but nowhere near the record $20 million sale paid for a Peconic estate that is now back on the market at\n$35.5 million\n. Parker has that listing as well.\nEarlier this year, a\n$10 million sale\nset a record for Mattituck as Florida-based buyers purchased the home at 1140 Park Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Many\nhave found real estate\nto be the perfect opportunity to score new wins.\nHere are some notable athletes who got in the game this year.\nFloyd Mayweather Jr.\nThe boxer-turned-investor has never been shy when it comes to flaunting his wealth, which he\u2019s putting to use in real estate. This week, he\nput up $100 million in equity\nto join forces with Go Partners on a luxury rental portfolio valued at $3 billion.\nThe pugilist also recently acquired a Black Spruce affordable housing portfolio consisting of 1,000 units in Morningside Heights for $402 million and invested in a $10 billion office portfolio of 18 assets owned by New York-based 601W Companies.\nFor good measure, Mayweather did something flashier, buying a large stake in the former Versace Mansion turned luxury boutique hotel Villa Casa Casuarina in Miami Beach. The former champion never lost a fight, but real estate can knock down even the savviest investors.\nManu Ginobili\nInstead of his trademark Eurostep, former San Antonio Spurs star Manu Ginobili is stepping up to the line in Homestead with plans for a $337 million mixed-use project.\nTeaming with other retired Argentinian athletes, including ex-soccer player Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, the NBA Hall of Famer is\nlooking to develop\na complex with a 10,000-seat soccer stadium, 38,000-square-foot basketball facility, 200-bed student housing building, 5,000-square-foot sports medicine center, a hotel with up to 150 rooms and sports fields.\nA majority of Miami-Dade County commissioners authorized the mayor to negotiate a lease agreement with the investment group.\nJonathan Vilma\n\nSuper Bowl winner Jonathan Vilma tackled receivers for the New York Jets and New Orleans Saints, but the linebacker decided to try\ntackling affordable housing this year\n. The former University of Miami star proposed a 102-unit project on a church site in Palm Beach County back in June.\nVilma partnered with the West Palm Beach Seventh Day Baptist Church to propose the apartment complex, as well as a new church building near Haverhill.\nMo Vaughn\nCompared to some of the other jocks dabbling in real estate this year, Mo Vaughn is a seasoned vet. The founder of affordable housing firm Omni America partnered with Hyperion Group\non a 147-unit apartment building\nwith ground-floor retail in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti neighborhood.\nVaughn, a former MVP first baseman for the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets, co-founded Omni with Schneur in 2004.\nTaj Gibson\nTaj Gibson is hanging on to the twilight days of his NBA career, but the Brooklyn native is also turning back to his hometown. In July, the former New York Knicks forward \u2014 who is currently on the Charlotte Hornets \u2014\nlaunched GFB Development\nand proposed a \u201ctransformational project\u201d alongside Alloy Development on Nassau Street.\nTobias Harris\nNBA basketball players Terry and Tobias Harris of Visionary Development Group want to build a 90-unit affordable housing complex in East Hollywood. Their firm filed plans for the\nseven-story building\nlast month, which would replace a laundromat on the site.\n",

It\u2019s not clear how much the two may have spent on upgrades to the home.\n\nThe over 8,800-square-foot Mediterranean-style property features six beds and eight baths on an over 1.5-acre lot. It has an office space in addition to six en-suite bedrooms, according to marketing materials.\nA major highlight of the home is its primary suite, which has a fireplace, a wet bar, a steam shower, a private gym and a balcony.\nThe amenities extend beyond the home, with the gated community offering residents tennis courts, pools, equestrian areas, hiking trails and a recreation center.\nA double staircase anchoring the foyer is just one of several parts of the home television viewers are likely to recognize from the family\u2019s reality TV show, which began airing on the E! network in 2007. The show enjoyed a 20-season run on the network, in addition to multiple spinoff series.\nIn 2022, the Kardashian-Jenner clan reemerged with a new spin on the family\u2019s classic series tracking their lives. They made the jump over to streaming service Hulu with the launch of \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A beauty mogul found a buyer for her Greenwich Village townhouse just three weeks after it hit the market.\nGlossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, snagged a signed contract for their home at 118 West 12th Street, last asking just under $19 million, according to the listing on Compass\u2019 website.\nThe couple bought the four-story pad for nearly $18 million in November under an LLC called The Ruby Doggo 2023 Trust Agreement, six months before apparently trading it for a historic brownstone in Brooklyn Heights.\nThe duo last month signed a contract to purchase\n1 Sidney Place\nfor $22 million, sources with knowledge of the sale told\nThe Real Deal\n. If the home closes for that price, it would be one of the most expensive single-family sales in Brooklyn, second only to 8 Montague Terrace, which sold for $25.5 million in 2020.\nDemand for homes in Brooklyn soared during and after the pandemic, with several neighborhoods in the borough securing their spot among the city\u2019s most coveted luxury markets.\nThis includes Brooklyn Heights, which ranked as the 21st priciest neighborhood in the city last quarter with a median sale price of more than $1.2 million, according to a\nProperty Shark report\n.\nBut prices in the Brooklyn neighborhood didn\u2019t quite reach those in Greenwich Village last quarter. The neighborhood ranked 19th in the report with a median sale price of nearly $1.4 million.\n\nThe downtown Manhattan townhouse, built in 1899, spans 6,600 square feet and has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features 1,600 square feet of outdoor space, including a backyard and terrace.\nThe Greek Revival home traded for nearly $15 million just two years prior to Weiss and Gaybrick\u2019s purchase, according to property records.\nClayton Orrigo, Stephen Ferrara and Eva Alt of Compass\u2019 The Hudson Advisory Team had the listing. Orrigo declined to comment on the identity of the buyer.\nThe 30-agent Hudson Advisory Team crowned\nTRD\u2019s\n2023 ranking\nof the top resale brokers in the city with more than $316 million in sales across 75 closed sell-side transactions.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Sabrina Saltiel, who represented the buyer in the deal, declined to comment.\nWeiss founded Glossier in 2014. The company\ndeveloped a cult following early on for products\nlike the Boy Brow eyebrow gel and reached a $2 billion valuation during her time as CEO. She stepped down from the role in 2022, the same year she and Gaybrick had their first child, and now serves as the executive chair.\nGaybrick is the president of product and business at the financial payment platform Stripe. The firm was recently valued at\n$65 billion\n, making it one of the highest-valued startups in the country along with SpaceX and OpenAI.\n",

Broker Santiago Arana from The Agency is handling the sale.\nThe mansion has 12 bedrooms and 24 bathrooms. There\u2019s also a 5,000-square-foot guesthouse, a caretaker house and a two-bedroom guardhouse.\nThe estate includes basketball and pickleball courts, a gym, a boxing ring, plus a sports lounge and bar in what is billed as a \u201cone-of-a-kind indoor sports complex.\u201d.\nIt\u2019s also a car collector\u2019s dream, with a 12-car garage \u2014 plus parking for 80 more vehicles.\n\nThe two-story white mansion, built on a promontory, overlooks what may be\nthe biggest zero-edge pool in town\n, at 155 feet long.\nThe French-style Wallingford Estate,\nbuilt in 2000\n, was modeled on Le Petit Trianon, Marie Antoinette\u2019s private ch\u00e2teau,\naccording to Forbes\n. It has a 5,300-square-foot master suite, plus a cinema, wine room and a whisky lounge. It also has a spa with a hair and nail salon, sauna, massage room and stylist area.\nIt was purchased by developer Gala Asher in November 2016 for $22 million, then revamped.\nIts prior owner, healthcare entrepreneur Jeoung Lee, bought the home after its previous owner, Curtis Somoza,\nwas caught in a $64 million Ponzi scheme\n, for which he was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.\nTMZ said it\u2019s expected that Lopez and Affleck could \u201close millions\u201d in the sale. They\u2019ll have to cover the broker\u2019s commission and\nthe so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d\non luxury home sales in Los Angeles. They also invested \u201csignificant money\u201d for home improvements, TMZ added.\nAffleck has already moved out of the Beverly Hills Post Office estate and rents a smaller mansion in Brentwood for $100,000 a month \u2014 just two blocks from the home of his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner,\nthe Daily Mail said.\nAffleck and Garner share three children together: Violet, 18, Fin, 15, and Samuel, 12.\nLopez, for her part, has been spotted house-hunting around Los Angeles in recent weeks,\nEntertainment Tonight reported.\nBut she also apparently tried to show there\u2019s still hope for the marriage by being photographed twice over the weekend wearing her wedding ring, according to Entertainment Tonight and\nPage Six.\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew\n",

Brody.\nThe 10-room unit, which takes up an entire floor of the building, has up to four bedrooms, hardwood floors, high ceilings, climate control and gallery-quality lighting, heated floors in bathrooms and a Sonos sound system.\nThe unit has a private elevator which leads to a square gallery, entertainment rooms, a living room (with a fireplace), dining room and wood-paneled library.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chef\u2019s eat-in kitchen, service pantry, laundry room, and a staff room with a full bath. The primary bedroom has views of Park Avenue as well as a fireplace, dressing room and bath.\u00a0 There is one additional bedroom with an ensuite bath..\nSchupf has used her family fortune to promote women\u2019s interest in STEM careers. She is a trustee of the New York Hall of Science, a trustee of the Eugene Lang College at The New School, and a trustee emerita of Skidmore College, according to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences website\n.\nHer trust is buying the co-op; if the trust also funds her philanthropy, it could be a business asset rather than a primary residence.\nShe also has said that she loves to cook but, unlike how her family amassed its fortune, she does not bake, according to CKBK.com.\n\u201cAt one point, I was thinking about being a kitchen design space planner and I enjoy designing kitchens that work,\u201d she says on the site. \u201cI am a cookbook collector, lover of well-designed and practical kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and basically anything to do with food. \u2026 Today my main focus is supporting STEM education, women scientists, and programs that encourage young women to engage in STEM. People do not think of cooking being a science, but it is. So let\u2019s get cookin!!\u201d",

Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 daughter paid\n$51 million\nfor a six-bedroom penthouse, which was among the 10 most expensive sales in the city last year.\nThough it has fetched lofty prices, some owners claim the building is\nriddled with defects\nand code violations, including some they considered \u201clife-threatening,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed by the condo board.\nIn the lawsuit, which seeks $376 million in damages, the board alleges there were leaks in the penthouses, improperly laid bricks and flooding in the courtyard, which lacked an effective drainage system.",

        "content": "Josephine Wright feared losing her home after a developer launched a lawsuit against her earlier this year. Now, she has a Hollywood hero coming to the rescue.\nThe filmmaker and philanthropist Tyler Perry is going to build the 93-year-old grandmother a five-bedroom house on her Hilton Head Island property, the\nIsland Packet\nreported. He is one of\na string of celebrities\n, including Snoop Dogg, Kyrie Irving, and Meek Mills, to provide financial support for\nWright\u2019s legal battle with developer Bailey Point Investment\n.\nWright says Bailey Point Investment opened a lawsuit against her earlier this year as a means of financially bullying the woman into selling them her property. Bailey Point Investment, a\nGeorgia\nentity registered with Jill Chowdhury-McLelland, is linked to McKinley Homes. McKinley Homes is a developer led by managing member Jinsong Yang with projects in Georgia, Alabama,\u00a0 North Carolina, South Carolina and New York, according to its website.\nBailey Point Investment is developing a 29-acre, 147-unit project, dubbed Bailey Point, on Hilton Head Island that surrounds Wright\u2019s 1.8-acre property. Wright\u2019s property has been in her family since the Civil War, she says. It is part of the legacy of Gullah Geechee people, descendents of enslaved Africans on the lower Atlantic coast who formed a unique creole culture and language.\n\nWright and her family say the lawsuit brought by Bailey Point was intended to cause financial hardship, and force her into a sale after she declined the developer\u2019s multiple offers to buy her home. Wright\u2019s family has raised $364,000 since launching their GoFundMe in May. The Town of Hilton Head Island has declined to issue building permits for Bailey Cove while the lawsuit is ongoing, the publication\nreported\nin August.\nIn September, it was reported that the lawsuit would go into mediation, a process that could still take months to conclude, according to the outlet.\nHilton Head has been a magnet for real estate development in recent years, with a pandemic-fueled influx of buyers causing a\nprice hike for homes in the area\n.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "The sale of Ilya Kovalchuk\u2019s incomplete New Jersey mansion has bedeviled the former NHL star for years, but those days could soon be over.\nThe Russian-born hockey player and his wife, singer Nicole Andrazajtis Kovalchuk, are in contract to sell their home at 10 Frick Drive in Alpine, the New York Post\nreported\n. The deal has yet to close, but sources told the outlet it\u2019s close to the last asking price of $10.9 million.\nThe couple listed the 22,000-square-foot property in 2019 for nearly $18 million, but buyers quickly vanquished their hopes of a quick and pricey sale to the penalty box. The ask was lowered to $16 million after a year, then\n$15 million last year\nbefore ultimately coming down to the latest ask.\nThe identity of the buyer was not reported.\nThe couple purchased the two-acre parcel in 2010 for $4.5 million, setting out to build a dream luxury property after Kovalchuk inked a 15-year, $100 million pact to remain a member of the New Jersey Devils for the balance of his career. Things fell apart on the ice, however, and Kovalchuk returned to Russia three years later, leaving a shell of a home behind.\nThe property, which will take the incoming owner an additional $6 million to complete, includes eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, along with several powder rooms and a \u201cbanquet-size\u201d dining room.\n\nThe home also has a chef\u2019s kitchen, prep kitchen, walk-in pantry and wine storage. Additional features include a lounge, theater, bar and guest suite.\nDennis McCormack of Prominent Properties Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nKovalchuk, a three-time NHL All-Star, played for the Atlanta Thrashers, Devils, Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens and Washington Capitals. He won an Olympic gold medal in 2018 while representing the unofficial Russian team, then served as general manager for the Russian Olympic Committee\u2019s men\u2019s ice hockey team that competed in Beijing four years later.\nThe Kovalchuk clan also put a Miami Beach luxury condo on the market for $14.5 million. That listing comes only a year after they purchased the pad on South Florida\u2019s exclusive Fisher Island\nfor $8.5 million\n, or $2,200 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property type is the most likely spot for celebrities to set up shop, accounting for 76 percent of the store type.\nWhile celebrity retail is nothing new, more stars are embracing physical stores after brushing against the limits of selling through the Internet and social media, a lesson traditional retail brands are also learning.\nAmong the power players in the celebrity retail space are Diddy and Kim Kardashian. The latter has an especially popular brand in\napparel company Skims\n, which recently opened a pop-up location at Manhattan\u2019s Rockefeller Center.\n\nThe beauty sector, however, is where celebrities reign supreme.

Across the country, asking rents are rising and available space is at an 18-year low as\nretail defies\nsome of the red flags tearing down other commercial real estate sectors, such as the office market.\nAs celebrity retailers give, however, they can take away just as quickly, warned JLL executive Richard Hodos.\n\u201cThese things have a life cycle,\u201d Hodos told the Observer. \u201cDoes it mean it will continue to be successful over the course of a 15-year lease?

It was on the market for nearly 12 years, and went through massive price reductions after initially being listed for almost $30 million. It was most recently listed for a little under $15 million before Cooper\u2019s purchase.\nCooper, 42, now resides in Chicago and recently celebrated his purchase with a birthday party at the estate, enjoying basketball and golf with friends \u2014 the home includes an indoor basketball court as well as a putting green.\n\u201cI\u2019ll announce some exciting plans for the property in January,\u201d Cooper told the publication, noting that a gate to the home adorned with a \u201c23\u201d in honor of Jordan\u2019s famous worn jersey number won\u2019t be changed. \u201cI do not have any major renovation plans. I will honor the property\u2019s legacy. This place is great just the way it is.\u201d\n\nThe property won\u2019t serve as Cooper\u2019s full-time residence, he said.\nHAN Capital\nwas founded by brothers Alex and Nik Turik before Cooper became its third partner. The firm buys, develops and operates self-storage, RV parks, campgrounds and manufactured housing around the nation, and in 2022 sold Chicago and Wilmette properties for a combined $32 million, as well as a\nnorthwest Indiana property for $17 million\n.\nThe Highland Park mansion was built in 1995 during Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls championship years, and features nine bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms and four half-baths, tennis court, cigar lounge, and the iconic \u201c23\u201d gate, in addition to the basketball and golf amenities.\nJordan initially purchased the estate for his family in the early 1990s but retained ownership after his divorce in 2006. Despite its luxurious features and ties to the NBA legend, the property\u2019s price proved a challenge in the Chicago-area ultra-luxury real estate market.\nJordan\u2019s sale reflects a\nbroader trend of high-end homeowners taking losses\nin the Chicago area, including a Lincoln Park estate that sold for $15.25 million after being listed at $50 million. Despite the deep discount from its initial listing price, the sale of Jordan\u2019s property is the fourth-highest home sale in the Chicago area this year and the most expensive non-lakefront deal in Highland Park history.\nMeanwhile, Jordan continues to reside primarily in Florida with his wife, Yvette Prieto, and spends summers traveling abroad.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry",

Residential brokers, however, see the other side of the coin.\nBrokers in the nation\u2019s capital are gearing up for an influx of government officials set to settle in the district when Trump is sworn in, the New York Post\nreported\n. It\u2019s a tradition that pops up every four years or so, when there\u2019s a changing of the guard at the White House. But a Trump administration also brings a potentially larger cohort of industry titans and billionaires.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty principal Michael Rankin told\nCurbed\nthat he expected some \u201cbig numbers\u201d to be transacted beginning next month as clarity over administrative posts emerges.\nNot all neighborhoods in D.C. are created equally, even for the political elite. Kalorama is a constant that should see activity, as should Massachusetts Heights. Among those to shack up in Kalorama at one point or another: former President Barack and first lady Michelle Obama, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Jeff Bezos \u2014 who paid\n$23 million\nin cash for the largest home in Washington, D.C. in 2017. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\nrecently moved\nto sell his home in the neighborhood.\nBut Georgetown, known as being a more liberal part of the district, isn\u2019t a beehive for Trump allies, hostess Sally Quinn\ntold Esquire\nin 2019.\n\nBethesda, which is just outside the city limits, is also a well-established hotspot for the wealthy.\nStill, the concerns facing commercial property owners in D.C. can bleed out into the residential market, too. If Trump guts the federal workforce, it may reduce homebuying demand in the area and even prompt holdovers to sell. Additionally, the president-elect\u2019s infatuation with Mar-a-Lago could lead those who want to be in his orbit to move to Florida, rather than D.C.\nThere\u2019s already activity afoot in Kalorama, where one prominent politics-adjacent figure is selling his home. Soon-to-be former CNN broadcaster Chris Wallace and his wife listed their home in the neighborhood for\n$6.4 million\nlast month.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property is 14,000 square feet, breaking down the listing price to approximately $1,564 per square foot.\nThe couple purchased the 7-acre estate for around $10 million in 2006. Moore, best known for starring on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d died in 2017. Levine decided to sell as part of the process of moving on after his wife\u2019s death.\nThe Georgian-style house was likely built late in the 19th century, but its exact origin is unknown. After the couple bought the home, they tore down virtually everything except the front facade, a three-year project that nearly doubled the size of the property and cost close to the asking price of the five-bedroom home.\nThe entryway has a curving staircase and harlequin-patterned floors, along with a wall of windows to look out on the garden and a skylight. The primary suite is in its own wing, containing dual dressing rooms, including a closet with 100 linear feet of hanging space.\n\nThe home also has a spa with a massage room, Jazucci and sauna, a gym with a ballet barre, a solarium (a personal favorite spot of Moore\u2019s, according to her husband), a billiards room and an outdoor pool.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Joseph Barbieri has the\nlisting\n. Levine said a portion of proceeds from the sale will go towards the Mary Tyler Moore Vision Initiative, which aims to preserve and restore vision for those with diabetes; Moore was diagnosed with diabetes in 1969 and was reportedly losing her vision due to the disease towards the end of her life.\nThe housing market in Greenwich has been constrained by low inventory, but notched some peak deals. A\n$139 million deal\nfor 50-acre Copper Beech Farm in August marked the largest sale in state history. Just last week, a home on a 27-acre estate in the town\nsold for $30 million\n.

The lot was part of a land swap the two arranged in 2020 when luxury real estate began to take off during the pandemic. Griffin now controls about 6.5 contiguous acres on Star Island.

The home is next to the property he purchased this summer for $68 million. Together, they total 4.6 contiguous acres of land acquired for almost $150 million.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill more attention and awareness of\nalleged fraud\nacross condo and homeowners\u2019 associations push potential buyers away?

Hochfelder wrote in his letter that he wanted to move forward with a\npotential $1.5 billion offer\nfor the sprawling golf resort, which is one of Trump\u2019s most valuable properties.\nElsewhere in Florida\nGov. Ron DeSantis directed the state\u2019s emergency management division to charter flights for Florida residents stranded in Israel and to deliver supplies to Israel. His order came hours after the Biden administration said it would charter flights to bring Americans back,\nPolitico reports\n.\nAt least\ntwo possible tornadoes\ntouched down in Florida early Thursday, damaging\u00a0 homes, cars and businesses in Clearwater Beach, as well as Crystal River.\nClimate change is resulting in stronger hurricanes forming much earlier in hurricane season, the\nMiami Herald reports\n. Category 4 and 5 storms are occurring about two weeks earlier on Earth than they were four decades ago. That increases the chance for stronger flooding.",

        "content": "With Halloween just a few days away, America\u2019s fascination with spooky and haunted houses is in peak season.\nFilm has certainly played a role in that enchantment, where homes are often characters, and even antagonists.\nMany times, the actual homes featured on the big screen find their way to the market and don\u2019t have a problem selling. After all, they were just film sets \u2026 right? But the fictional homes may have you asking questions like: Who would buy this? How much would it cost? How would you market this?\nAnd despite high interest rates, it\u2019s still a seller\u2019s market with a major inventory shortage, so even someone who isn\u2019t a horror cinefile may consider such terrifying abodes.\nSo instead of just asking ourselves these questions, we checked in with brokers from around the country to give us their thoughts on how they would handle such frightful listings.\n\u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d\n(112 [formerly 108] Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York)\nThe mother of all haunted houses, this 1927 Dutch Colonial is infamous for Ronald DeFeo Jr. killing six family members in it in real life. That and subsequent events spawned nine books and nearly 50 films, some more well-known than others.\nWhat it would go for without controversy\n$1 million to $1.3 million\nNicholas Campasano and Ricardo Pena of The Agency said the home would easily fetch that price given the square footage, the boathouse (which typically can\u2019t be built any more in that area of Long Island due to the environmental regulations), the two car garage, finished basement and location in Amityville.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high-demand area; you don\u2019t see a lot of turnover there,\u201d Campasano said.\n\u201cAmityville is a tight-knit community, it dates back to summer cottages, and dignitaries would come and summer there. That\u2019s how it got started. If you\u2019re not from there, you know it right away. They know who their neighbors are. It\u2019s a beautiful community, really.\u201d\nSo residents must love all the attention, right?\n\u201cThey hate it,\u201d Campasano said.\nWhat it would go for if it were haunted:\n5% to 30% off\n\u201cIf you walked in the house and heard voices say, \u2018Get out,\u2019 that would affect the value,\u201d Campasano said. \u201cAfter the murder, it took 15 months for the house to actually sell. It did sit for a while. But it does go to show you that obviously there\u2019s a buyer for every property. Even after everything that happened, the house still did sell.\u201d\nHow to market it\nPena said selling a haunted Amityville Horror home would call for unconventional methods.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to go through different buyers, make sure you have it at trade shows and forums and paranormal enthusiasts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make sure the property is in front of those eyes, because that\u2019s who it\u2019s going to be most appealing to. Anyone else might think that\u2019s a bad thing. They may find it amazing.\n\u201cYou should definitely lean into it. Host an open house at night, so buyers come in and see nothing is creaking and squeaking. It\u2019s a good way to get buyers to get comfortable.\u00a0 Maybe put up a sign, \u2018We already spoke to the ghosts. We\u2019re doing our best to work with ghosts.\u2019 They want owners to haunt, too. Ghosts get bored, too.\u201d\nCampasano said there is definitely a market for the home.\n\u201cThe original address was 112 and the town went so far as to change it to 108, because so many people that were fans of the books and the movies were coming by to take pictures and see the house,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of interest in the house and the property itself.\u201d\nOne way to further lean in, Campasano said, is to rename the property like they used to in the area years ago. In 1925, the owner of the home renamed it \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d Campasano said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic, perhaps, but play into it and rename it,\u201d he said. \u201cHigher Hopes, maybe, and put the name over the door\u201d\n\u201cPoltergeist\u201d\n(4267 Roxbury Street, Simi Valley, California)\nThe 2,400-square-foot house, which sits on a 0.37-acre lot, featured in one of the scariest and most iconic movies from the 1980s. The film, which centered on a little girl being kidnapped through a television by malevolent spirits, was set in a fictional development in Southern California. But the home is in Simi Valley.\nWhat it would go for without controversy\n$820,000\nBroker Tim Gavin, based in Beverly Hills, said the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home is typical for the area. \u2026. \u2026 Or is it?\nWhat would it go for if haunted\n$950,000\nTaking the road less traveled, Gavin said he\u2019d be able to fetch top dollar for a home that has nightmarish toy clowns and is built on an old Native American burial ground.\nHow he would market it\n\u201cReal estate is a seasonal business,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cIf we are in the Halloween time of the year, we\u2019re gonna bump that price up to about $950,000 with all the freaks that are enamored by the legacy films like \u2018Poltergeist,\u2019 so they\u2019re going to have to pay that premium value. And of course the TV comes with the home. That sticks to the property and that is an added value.\u201d\nGavin also is unconcerned about that burial ground.\n\u201cNah, we\u2019ll go ahead and disclose that. Everything is in the disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody. But you have to build a narrative for those it appeals to, and when you have that narrative, people will see it as value.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the freaks here. This is a legacy property. This is a trophy property. These don\u2019t come up often. If you want it, you\u2019re going to have to pay a premium, you sicko.\u201d\nThe TV stays, but, whatever you do, don\u2019t highlight the schools.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a starter home,\u201d Gavin said, dancing around the uncomfortable truth that a child or two might go missing should they move in. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this is a home for a family, even though it is four bedrooms. But I would say it\u2019s for a couple.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and there is attic space in the house, but we don\u2019t recommend you go in there.\u201d\n\u201c\nGhostbusters\u201d\n(55 Central Park West, NYC)\nOK, OK, you could argue it\u2019s not a horror flick, but it\u2019s also not entirely a comedy, either, what with Ray Parker Jr. trying to convince himself he \u201cain\u2019t afraid of no ghost\u201d in the theme song. It\u2019s also one of several films that combines the paranormal and a New York high-rise.\nWe enlisted broker Amelia Gewirtz of Brown, Harris, Stevens Upper West Side to take a stab at this one. Gewirtz has as good a credentials as anyone to weigh in. In addition to being a lifelong New Yorker and broker with more than 30 years of experience, she also appeared on the soundtrack to the 2002 horror movie \u201cWishmaster 4\u201d as a member of her band Amelia\u2019s Dream.\nWhat it would go for without controversy\nGewirtz said a standard, one-bedroom unit on the 12th floor recently sold for $1.3 million.\nWhat would it go for if haunted\nUnclear. Maybe more, maybe less. That\u2019s New York City, baby.\n\u201cThere might be people they want money off, like with \u2018The Amityville Horror,\u2019\u201d Gewirtz said. \u201cIt took forever for them to sell that. So there might be people you might take the money off, but there might be people who might pay more for it. It\u2019s New York. It\u2019s a different kind of place. We have our eccentric people, maybe it would go to a bidding war.\u201d\nHow she would market it\n\u201cI would market it, \u2018Someone might pay more for free housekeeping, because the ghosts move the furniture for you.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Who needs cable? Free entertainment with paranormal activity.\u2019 \u2026 Maybe, \u2018Fast commute from room to room, move through walls with ease.\u2019 You could say, \u2018If a personality inhabits you, you\u2019ll never be bored or alone.\u2019\u201d\nThere is no Dana, only Zuul \u2026 and her trusty real estate broker going the extra mile for her client.\n\u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d\n(The Bramford, a fictional building modeled after The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street, New York City)\nA real estate agent showing a classic Upper West Side apartment to a young married couple sets the scene of this 1967 horror show. It\u2019s not haunted, but it turns out their building is chock full of malevolent (is there any other kind?) Satan worshipers, but it has a laundry room. How cheap does the rent have to be to tolerate giving birth to the antichrist?\nWhat a unit would sell for without controversy\nAbout $2 million for a one-bedroom, $4 million for a two-bedroom.\nWhat a unit would sell for if the neighbors belonged to a satanic cult trying to have you impregnated with the son of the devil\nKnock off about 20 percent\nIf your neighbors are devil worshippers, it\u2019s time to party, Gewirtz said.\n\u201cYou get a DJ in there and you make it a fun night,\u201d Gewirtz quipped before adding, \u201cI have had people purchase apartments from me that are religious and have had meetings in their apartments, but I\u2019ve never heard a neighbor complain.\n\u201cI think if we had crazy devil worshippers next door, again, I would lean into it with the marketing. But it could lead to bidding wars because it is New York City and it is eccentric.\nShe also joked that the low inventory means buyers have to maybe compromise, even if that means raising Old Scratch\u2019s progeny.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be flexible and bend a little bit. Just let it go,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nGewirtz, incidentally, knows of what she speaks, having sold a property next door to a neighbor far more disruptive than a coven of devil worshippers: a Columbia University fraternity.\nDuring the showing, the brothers were in the adjacent garden chugging an alcoholic concoction out of gallon-size containers, Gewirtz said.\n\u201cThe kids started chanting, \u2018Buy the house, buy the house!\u2019 They were \u2018Animal House\u2019 in real life. I told the client, \u2018Well, see, you can use it as a rental and [the tenants] would have friends.\u201d\nEven with the encounter, or because of it, the client bought the property close to the asking price, Gewirtz said.\n\u201cHe wanted to make the deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI could put my head on the pillow, even though I\u2019m a seller\u2019s advocate. I said to the seller, \u2018He will sign the contract.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBeetlejuice\u201d\n(White River, Connecticut. Substituted for Kent)\nTim Burton\u2019s anarchic \u201cghost with the most\u201d turned haunting into an art form in 1988 and became a part of the zeitgeist. Capitalizing on the white-hot success of the original, Burton and star Michael Keaton immediately set about making a sequel that\u2019s set to be released in September 2024.\nAnyway, the gothic home where the original is staged doesn\u2019t really exist \u2014 facades were used and the exterior shots were filmed in Vermont. But real estate agent Carole King of Keller Williams\nHow much would it cost without controversy\n$450,000\nKing said it\u2019s an interesting four-bedroom, four-bathroom home with an attic and chef\u2019s kitchen set on three acres. But it wouldn\u2019t likely sell for more than that.\nHow mu\nch would it cost if really haunted\n$450,000\nThis is where King deviated from her colleagues. She said she would not play with the listing at all.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the seller\u2019s imagination. How do I know unless I saw it myself?\u201d Kind said. \u201cIn Connecticut, you don\u2019t have to disclose paranormal activity. If I put \u2018haunted house\u2019 on the listing, the only person who would buy it is someone in the market, and who craves buying haunted houses. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t sell.\u201d\nKing brings up an interesting point about disclosures.\nA handful of states have laws on the books concerning disclosures of paranormal activity in the sale of real estate. New Jersey requires that the seller disclose known info if the buyer asks.\nNew York has case law that says a sale will be rescinded if the seller takes unfair advantage of buyer\u2019s ignorance as to the house\u2019s reputation of paranormal activity; and the seller creates and perpetuates that reputation, according to Zillow.\nMinnesota and Massachusetts have laws that say there is no duty to disclose paranormal activity, protecting sellers and agents.",

        "content": "Selling Michael Jordan\u2019s ultra-personalized compound has been anything but a slam dunk. The massive home has remained on the market for 12 years and slashed its price twice.\nJordan\nmade his mark on the Chicago area estate: His name is painted on the basketball court, flags wave with his Air Jordan logo, and his jersey number adorns the gate, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. Jordan first listed the mansion at 2700 Point Lane in Highland Park, Illinois for $29 million in 2012, chopping it down to $16 million in 2014, and to $14.9 million in 2015, Compass shows.\nThat falls far short of what he paid to build the 7-acre estate. Listing agent Katherine Malkin of Compass told the outlet he spent about $50 million constructing the 32,700-square-foot mansion, which was completed in 1995. It spans nine bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms and four half-bathrooms, a gym, regulation basketball court, locker room, trophy room, theater, cigar room, putting green, tennis court and pool.\nMalkin sees Jordan\u2019s personal touches as the property\u2019s selling point, rather than a hindrance. The real sticking point at this price point is that Jordan\u2019s home is non-waterfront.\n\u201cMost people who are spending that kind of money in the Chicago area want to live on the lake,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cHe chose to not live on the lake because they wanted privacy.\u201d\n\nDespite his home languishing on the market, Jordan has no plans for more price cuts, according to Malkin. That comes with a cost: the hall of famer has paid more than $1 million in property taxes since first listing the mansion, and also pays for a housekeeper, property manager and security.\n\u201cWhy? Because he can,\u201d Malkin told the outlet. Jordan\u2019s net worth is $3.2 billion, according to Forbes.\nHis primary residence is in Jupiter\u2019s gated\nBear\u2019s Club\n, a Jack Nicklaus-designed luxury golf community. He and wife Yvette Prieto live in the 26,000-square-foot mansion at 172 Bears Club Drive, which has a guest house, guard tower, pool, gym and basketball court. In April, Jordan bought a second Bear\u2019s Club mansion for\n$16.5 million\n.\nJordan isn\u2019t the only Chicagoland seller facing a massive loss on a mansion. Last month a Lincoln Park estate that cost $65 million to build sold for\n$15.3 million\n.\n\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "A year after going into contract to buy a trophy estate in Indian Creek Village, French DJ and music producer David Guetta sold his Setai Miami Beach condo for $16 million.\nGuetta sold unit 3709 in the tower at 101 20th Street to an undisclosed buyer. The sale closed last week, and the deed has yet to be recorded.\nMichael Wiesenfeld of the Corcoran Group represented the seller, and Eloy Carmenate, Mick Duchon and Joshua Winarick, also of Corcoran, brought the buyer. At $6,337 per square foot, the deal sets a price per square foot record for Miami Beach, according to a Corcoran spokesperson.\n\nGuetta is a French DJ known for producing some of the most popular songs of the 2000s and 2010s. His discography includes \u201cWhere Them Girls At,\u201d\nfeaturing Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj; \u201cWithout You,\u201d featuring Usher; and \u201cTitanium,\u201d featuring Sia. He\u2019s also won two Grammy Awards.\nGuetta bought the Setai condo from developer\nRichard LeFrak\nin 2018 for\n$9.5 million\n. The 2,500-square-foot unit has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, property records show. The 40-story oceanfront condo-hotel was built in 2005, and has more than 160 units, according to published reports. The billionaire Nakash family, which founded Jordache Jeans and has an estimated $1.9 billion net worth according to Forbes, bought the hotel portion for\n$90 million\nin 2014.\nFor his part, Guetta is considerably upsizing from the Setai unit. Last year, he went into contract to buy a 1.2-acre spec estate with 118 feet of waterfront in Indian Creek Village. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners have the 16,000-square-foot mansion listed for\n$69 million\n, and the sale is still pending.\nGuetta will have plenty of celebrity neighbors on the private island. Indian Creek has been a hub of\ntrophy deals\nattached to big names in recent years. Since October, billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has snapped up three homes on the island in three separate deals totaling\n$234 million\n. Dutch magnetics heir Geert-Jan Bakker sold his waterfront estate to an undisclosed buyer for\n$64.5 million\nin May. In July, Tom Brady scored\na $35 million construction loan\nfor the mansion he\u2019s building on the island. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner bought a home on the island for\n$24 million\nin 2021.",

Oladipo listed the house for $10 million in June, Redfin shows.\nThe two-time NBA All-Star has suffered repeated injury over the course of his 10-year career in the league. The Heat traded him to the Thunder in July, although there is some speculation he could be traded again, Hogan said. In June, Oladipo filed suit against his longtime manager, James Henderson, alleging he stole $1.3 million from Oladipo and invested it in a strip club and a condo, according to the\nBleacher Report.\nWhile his basketball future is unknown, Oladipo wants to maintain a \u201chome base\u201d in the Miami area, and wants a larger yard for his daughter, Hogan confirmed.

A company managed by the couple paid $18.7 million for the unit in 2021.\nDouglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer represented the sellers of the 7,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom condo at 7001 Fisher Island Drive. It hit the market in January. Goldentayer declined to comment.\nLast week, buyers signed contracts for 15 luxury homes and condos in Miami-Dade County asking a combined $213.6 million, according to the report, authored by the Douglas Elliman mega team. That\u2019s four fewer than\nthe week prior,\nbut a $69 million weekly increase in dollar volume.\n\nNine of the contracts signed last week were for single-family homes, and six were for condos.\nThe most expensive single-family home to enter into contract is the house at 2700 Sunset Drive in Miami Beach. Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd and his wife Laurie hired spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser to build the roughly 9,000-square-foot mansion on the property, which is asking nearly $40 million. The couple paid\n$11.2 million for the half-acre lot\nin 2021.\nThe single-family homes priced at $4 million and up that went into contract last week spent 163 days on the market on average before securing buyers. The asking dollar volume for those homes totaled $132.6 million.\nThe luxury condos that entered into contracts were on the market for an average of 198 days, and averaged about $2,800 per square foot. The total dollar asking volume for the condos was $81 million.\u00a0Eklund-Gomes\u2019 report mimics the Olshan report released weekly covering Manhattan luxury contracts. In New York, buyers signed contracts for\n24 homes last week,\naccording to the latest Olshan report.

        "content": "This year saw record prices for waterfront homes and new projects launched by developers, buoyed by enduring demand.\nOn the flip side, South Florida\u2019s office market slowed down. High interest rates stifled multifamily. And residential brokerages adapted to changes brought by a landmark settlement in the class action lawsuit filed against the National Association of Realtors and a handful of firms.\nBut the stories that really dominated South Florida real estate headlines in 2024 were the scandals that brought down once-prominent brokers and developers.\nBrothers Oren and Tal Alexander, accused of rape in civil lawsuits first reported by\nThe Real Deal\nthis summer, were arrested by the FBI on federal sex trafficking charges in December.\nIn July,\nSergio Pino\n, who led the largest Hispanic-owned homebuilding firm in the country, died by suicide when the FBI showed up to his home to arrest him for allegedly trying to murder his estranged wife multiple times.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the top stories of the year:\nMiami Beach luxury broker Oren Alexander and his brothers charged with sex trafficking\nOren, Alon and Tal were all accused of rape and sexual assault in civil lawsuits, prompting an FBI investigation into the brothers. Oren and Tal led Official Partners, a Side-backed brokerage, while their brother Alon was an executive at the family\u2019s private security firm, Kent Security. Oren and Tal became brokers to the 1 percent of buyers and sellers over the course of their decade-long career at Douglas Elliman, before they left the brokerage in 2022.\nIn the months after the rape accusations became public, the Alexanders took full control of Official. The agency lost its new development business and most of its agents, and appears to have shut down.\nIn December, the FBI arrested Oren and Alon on state sexual battery charges. The three brothers were also indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and are being held at the Miami federal detention center. Prosecutors allege they drugged and raped women dating back to when the brothers\u2019 high school days in North Miami Beach. If convicted, they face a minimum of 15 years or up to life in prison.\nSergio Pino, accused of ordering multiple hits on his estranged wife, dies by suicide\nThe late Pino, who founded Century Homebuilders Group, was about to be arrested by the FBI in mid-July when he shot himself to death at his Coral Gables home. The FBI alleged that Pino hired hitmen to murder Tatiana Pino. The couple was in the middle of a nasty divorce: Tatiana had claimed in court that Sergio tried to kill her by poisoning her with fentanyl and bath salts.\nTatiana Pino\nbecame president of Century Homebuilders following his death, but Sergio\u2019s brother, Carlos Pino, levied a court fight for a\nstake in the company\n.\nHigh interest rates suppress commercial real estate\nOffice leasing slowed down, in part due to fewer companies relocating to the region and elevated interest rates. Some companies that leased office space during the pandemic-fueled boom backed out of their leases.\nInvestment sales\nof office buildings also declined.\n\nMultifamily developers and landlords also suffered at the hands of high interest rates. Pricing fell, and no single-asset purchase reached $200 million.\nSome commercial landlords faltered, including Raoul Thomas of CGI Merchant Group. Thomas lost two of his hotels to lenders and has other loans that are delinquent or in special servicing.\nForeclosures\nin general ticked up.\nCondo market forced to face new legislation, condo buyouts stutter + crackdown on HOAs\nIt was a turbulent year for existing condo communities and homeowners associations as a result of new statewide legislation. More unit owners and former and current board members are speaking out over alleged election meddling, the misappropriations of funds and alleged insider deals. The Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s office continues to charge people in the massive fraud at the\nHammocks\n, one of Florida\u2019s largest HOAs. The scheme was first uncovered in 2022.\nAlso, it\u2019s become\nmore expensive\nto live in condo communities because associations are forced to fund repairs and cover the increased cost of insurance, prompting some owners to sell. Older buildings or those that are short of funding or in need of repairs are less desirable to prospective buyers.\nThis should, in theory, propel developers to complete buyouts of condo buildings that are in prime locations with desirable zoning. But few, if any, large-scale buyouts closed.\nAn appeals court ruling entered in March\nput some deals in limbo\n, and the future of a planned luxury condo project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater in jeopardy. The ruling found that for any condominium association where a termination requires 100 percent buy-in by the unit owners, a developer likely can\u2019t buy the majority of units and vote to change the rules without 100 percent support. Some developers would take this route as a \u201cback-door\u201d way to push terminations forward.\nRetail remains strong, but restaurant industry sees record turnover\nSouth Florida\u2019s retail market\nperformed well\n, spurring a number of institutional trades of grocery-anchored shopping centers.\nRestaurants, on the other hand, were the\nvictims of record turnover\nduring one of the most challenging years for the food and beverage industry. Mom-and-pop operators and big chain restaurants alike had to close their doors after suffering a particularly slow summer. Still, many spaces were quickly filled by prospective operators willing to pay six- and seven-figure sums, on top of their monthly rent.\nCondo developers keep launching projects, many with brand names or short-term rental flexibility\nDozens of condo projects moved forward across South Florida. The trend of\nbranded condos\nexpanded further into Palm Beach and Broward counties. Developers teamed up with brands that include Viceroy, Standard, Armani/Casa and Pagani.\nMany secured large construction loans despite a challenging financing environment. Because developers can tap into buyers\u2019 deposits, lenders view these developments as less risky than others. Most of the projects in the pipeline across South Florida are now branded, and some offer owners short-term rental flexibility.\nPMG and its partners secured the largest construction financing package: $668 million for the planned Waldorf Astoria Hotel &amp; Residences supertall in downtown Miami, in June. Bank OZK, the most active construction lender in the region, and Related Fund Management are the lenders.\nDespite the condo market\u2019s strength, some projects faltered and stalled and/or are facing lawsuits.

        "content": "Ivan Lendl, one of the greatest tennis players of all time, has added another distinction to his record: priciest home sale in the history of Litchfield County.\nThe legendary athlete sold his 445-acre estate at 400 5 \u00bd Mile Road in Cornwall, Connecticut, for $12 million, Mansion Global\nreported\n. Last week\u2019s deal narrowly surpassed an $11.5 million deal to become the most expensive in county history.\nWhile the sale was a victory for Lendl, who won\neight major titles\nfrom 1984 to 1990, it took quite a bit longer than a fortnight. The property had been on and off the market since he listed it eight years ago for $19.8 million. Lendl lowered the price\nto $16.4 million\nin March 2021 and most recently to $15 million.\nThe former world No. 1 purchased the enormous estate in the 1980s for $4.2 million.\n\nThe vast plot of land has an 18,000-square-foot mansion roughly two hours from New York City and Boston. The home has 10 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, a gym, a locker room, an outdoor granite pool, a fishing pond, a barn and, of course, a tennis court.\nArchitect Allan Greenberg designed the three-story home for Lendl and his wife, Samantha. Before then, the couple lived in a seven-bedroom mansion in Greenwich, which they sold in 2020 for $5.2 million. The couple had been using the Cornwall estate as a summer-fall house, going back and forth from Florida.\nThe buyer of Lendl\u2019s massive estate could not immediately be discerned. Elyse Harney Real Estate\u2019s Elyse Harney Morris and Bill Melnick had the\nlisting\n. William Raveis\u2019 Kiara Rusconi represented the buyer.\nLendl earned more than $21 million in prize money during his playing career, winning the Australian Open twice, the French Open three times and the U.S. Open from 1985 to 1987. The Czech native was also a two-time Wimbledon finalist. In retirement, Lendl has coached the likes of tennis superstars Andy Murray and Alexander Zverev.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

His Wyoming ranch, once bustling with development activity, is now deserted, with structures abandoned under a blanket of snow, the outlet reported.\nIn Los Angeles, a plot of land intended for West\u2019s Donda Academy has been left deserted.\nAdditionally, his Calabasas ranch, featuring a failed dome project, displays scattered trash and a stranded dune buggy. West\u2019s Hidden Hills homes, including the one across the street from ex-wife Kim Kardashian, also appear abandoned and untouched.\n\nThe decline in West\u2019s real estate ventures parallels the challenges he has faced in his career and public image, with controversies and personal issues \u2014 including frequent anti-Semitic statements \u2014 affecting his billion-dollar status as a fashion and music mogul.\nIt\u2019s a far cry from\nWest\u2019s plans from 2019\n, when the celebrity publicly declared his intentions to build a real estate\nempire\nand delve into urban design \u2014 an announcement that proved divisive.\nDuring\nan interview\nwith television and radio personality Charlemagne Tha God, West said he wanted to be \u201cone of the biggest real estate developers of all time, what Howard Hughes was to aircrafts and Henry Ford was to cars\u2026We\u2019re going to develop cities.\u201d\nLater that month, he announced a plan to launch an architectural practice called \u201c\nYeezy home\n\u201d with an aim to \u201cmake the world better.\u201d West envisioned the design as having potential for affordable housing, but since that announcement, little has panned out. Meanwhile, West\u2019s multiple properties fall into further disrepair.\nSo long for being \u201cone of the biggest real estate developers of all time.\u201d\n\u2014 Ted Glanzer",

Dianne Feinstein is on the market.\nFeinstein\u2019s former home at 3300 Nebraska Ave NW in the Spring Valley neighborhood is being offered for $8.5 million, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. She and husband Richard Blum, who died a year before Feinstein, purchased the home in 2001 for $5.6 million.\nThe nearly one-acre property features multiple structures, including a main home built around the 1950s with three bedrooms, a private library, a two-story great room and a sunroom. The estate also includes a pool house, a structure with changing rooms and a carriage house with a top-floor apartment.\nWashington Fine Properties\u2019 Ben Roth holds the listing.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s home is coming on the market at what could be a good time. Thomas Anderson of WFP told the Journal that the luxury property market in the nation\u2019s capital often adheres to the election cycle, with rising demand expected as the 2024 election unfolds in November. That could help explain why other properties, including Ireland\u2019s ambassadorial residence, are also coming to market.\nAdditionally, a few prominent political figures recently sold their homes in the capital. This month, Donald Trump\u2019s one-time Secretary of State Rex Tillerson agreed to sell his home in the Kalorama neighborhood\nfor $6.5 million\n. Lobbyist Tony Podesta sold his home in the same neighborhood for $8.2 million.\nSince Feinstein\u2019s death,\nlegal disputes\nhave emerged regarding her real estate. One involved her home in Stinson Beach on the West Coast, which pitted Feinstein\u2019s daughter against a business associate of her late husband, who had a share in a trust that owned the home transferred to him upon Blum\u2019s death. In November, Katherine sought to dismiss a lawsuit regarding the home after it\nsold for $9.1 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The couple purchased the home\nonly three years ago\nfor $17 million.\nThe \u201cGoddess of Pop\u201d hasn\u2019t lived there since 1996. Her occupancy of the mansion was relatively brief, buying it in 1993 for $1.5 million as her abode away from the public eye before selling it three years later for $4.4 million, when it was purchased by Calvin Klein co-founder Barry Schwartz.\nIt\u2019s not clear why the Eatons are eager to sell. It\u2019s one of only 30 waterfront homes on guard-gated La Gorce Island and a property the couple spent two years gut-renovating.\nBuilt in 1953, the estate covers three-quarters of an acre and has 150 feet of frontage on Biscayne Bay. The main home is more than 12,000 square feet large with six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and an interior courtyard crafted into the design.\n\nThe exterior space includes a 50-foot long pool, a pool house, a hot tub, a cold plunge and an outdoor shower.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer has the listing, which breaks down to roughly $3,415 per square foot.\nCher, a 77-year-old multihyphenate, is best known for songs such as \u201cBelieve\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time,\u201d movies like \u201cMoonstruck\u201d and being half of the famous duo known as Sonny &amp; Cher. While her work in entertainment has slowed, she recently launched a line of gelato.\nShe\u2019s also working hard on selling real estate that still belongs to her. Last year, Cher listed a Malibu home she\u2019s owned since prior to her La Gorce Island stay for\n$85 million\n.

Pleterski\u2019s extravagant lifestyle, funded by investor money, led to his bankruptcy, the Times reported, citing a banking analysis by a bankruptcy trustee.\nPleterski had been kidnapped, beaten and tortured by one of his aggrieved investors and four others in December of the year prior. The incident prompted increased security measures, and Pleterski eventually moved out for his own safety. However, angry visitors persisted, causing another resident to flee.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander is now seeking to nullify the sale, claiming that the previous owner\u2019s real estate company concealed information about the alarming history of the house and its connection to Pleterski, which created an obvious security threat.\nThe former owner, the head of a Toronto real estate company, justified the nondisclosure by asserting that any purchaser investing more than $8 million in a luxury home would prioritize privacy and avoid a property with a history of threatening visits.\nGilgeous-Alexander\u2019s lawsuit recounts a disturbing incident where an uninvited visitor appeared at the property, demanding to see Pleterski. Despite being informed that no one by that name was present, the visitor lingered, prompting concerns about threats to the property.\nThe response from the company owned by Gilgeous-Alexander contends that the frequency and potential danger posed by uninvited visitors were downplayed.\nHowever, statements from Sandeep Gupta, who handled dealings with Pleterski, paint a different picture, describing daily visits from people seeking Pleterski and characterizing the situation as \u201cvery bad.\u201d\n\u2014 Ted Glanzer",

Investments, owes the brokerage $300,000. That represents the 3 percent commission allegedly earned from last month\u2019s deal headlined by the Miami-based hip-hop artist, whose real name is Tramar Dillard.\nKeyes\ndeclined comment through a spokesman. Peter Izaak, manager of G.I.A. Investments, said the allegations in Keyes\u2019 lawsuit are false. \u201cIt\u2019s in our lawyers\u2019 hands,\u201d Izaak said via text message. \u201cAnd the listing ended many months before any discussion of a sale.\u201d\nThe deal closed on July 14. Strong Arm Management, an entity managed by Prince and Flo Rida, whose hit songs include \u201cLow\u201d and \u201cGood Feeling,\u201d acquired Cloverleaf Shopping Plaza, a 27,800-square-foot strip mall at 18130, 18138, 18164 and 18230 Northwest Second Avenue, as well as 230 Northwest 183rd Street.\n\nIn October of last year, G.I.A entered into a commercial listing agreement with Keyes to market Cloverleaf Shopping Plaza for sale, the lawsuit states. A copy of the agreement is attached to the lawsuit. Keyes subsequently advertised and promoted the property on multiple marketing services and using multiple methods to attract buyers, the lawsuit alleges.\nIn a July certified letter mailed to Izaak, Keyes attorney David Israel claims that the brokerage is entitled to its commission payment \u201cfor procuring a prospective buyer for the subject property, whether directly or not.\u201d\nG.I.A. \u201cfailed and refused\u201d to pay\nKeyes\ndespite \u201cprevious friendly efforts\u201d to obtain the commission,\u201d Israel wrote. \u201cInstead, you have attempted to argue that the listing agreement expired in 2021, which is clearly not true,\u201d he added. \u201c[Keyes] will not continue to entertain your misstatements and will only accept commissions which are due and owing to [Keyes] without further delay.\u201d\nA family-run company, Keyes is one of the oldest and largest independent brokerages in Florida. Keyes is led by CEO Mike Pappas and his daughter, company president\nChristina Pappas\n.",

        "content": "Brazilian mogul Leo Kryss sold his waterfront estate on Indian Creek Island to billionaire Jeff Bezos for $79 million last year. He had enlisted Douglas Elliman to sell the property, and the brokerage would get a 4 percent total commission if it also represented the buyer.\nBut he didn\u2019t know he was selling the\nproperty to Bezos\n, the billionaire founder of Amazon. In fact, he said he was told the opposite \u2014 even after Bezos bought the neighboring property first for $68 million. Elliman Florida CEO Jay Parker insisted that Bezos was not behind the entity that had offered Kryss $79 million, an email in court records shows.\nWho knew what and when is at the center of a lawsuit filed this summer against Douglas Elliman, which alleges that the brokerage breached its duties to deal honestly and fairly with Kryss\u2019 company, Tendencia Asset Management, and that it \u201cfailed to use skill, care and diligence\u201d with respect to listing and selling Kryss\u2019 home at 12 Indian Creek Island Road.\nKryss claims he was persuaded to sell his property for $6 million less than the asking price because of Parker\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, according to the complaint, which was filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court by Akerman attorneys Dana Clayton and Lorayne Perez. In a statement provided to\nThe Real Deal,\nClayton said that Elliman violated Florida law and the listing agreement.\nDouglas Elliman declined to comment.\nKryss, who co-founded the Brazilian electronics and toy company Tectoy, hired top Elliman broker Dina Goldentayer and Danilo Tavares, also an agent with the brokerage, to list the property in May of last year. Kryss wanted to sell the company that owned the real estate, a Bahamian entity, for $85 million because he thought he would net a higher profit, according to the complaint.\nThe guard-gated island, considered a billionaires\u2019 bunker, is home to Tom Brady,\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner\n, and DJ and producer\nDavid Guetta\n\u2019s future mansion, as well as Eddie Lampert and Carl Icahn.\n\nIn June 2023, Bezos paid $68 million for the waterfront property next door at 11 Indian Creek Island Road. Though he was rumored to be purchasing that property as early as May of that year, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n, his identity as the buyer was\nrevealed on Aug. 11\n, 2023.\nA month later, Kryss and an entity, Cape Trust, entered into a purchase agreement for his home at 12 Indian Creek Island Road. Parker said that Indian Creek Mayor Benny Klepach, who allegedly acted as the straw buyer, had told Parker that the property was for Klepach\u2019s family.\n\u201cParker and the broker failed to disclose the source of the information or take any further steps to confirm the accuracy of this statement,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nElliman had recently brought on Klepach\u2019s daughter, Celine, as a sales associate. She ended up receiving a commission on the deal \u201cdespite not having been involved in the transaction until then,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nElliman\u2019s commission was about $3.2 million, the majority of which it would likely pay out to its agents, Goldentayer, Tavares and Klepach\u2019s daughter. Celine Klepach is no longer with Elliman, state licensing records show.\nIn Elliman\u2019s pending motion to dismiss, filed by Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, the brokerage claims that Cape Trust kept Bezos\u2019 identity from everyone, including Elliman, Parker and the agents involved in the deal. Douglas Elliman said it did not have a duty to investigate the trust as a transaction broker.\n\u201cEven if the Douglas Elliman agents and its Florida CEO did have such knowledge, it did not materially affect the value of the property,\u201d according to Elliman\u2019s motion.\nBezos, the third richest person in the world with a net worth of nearly $200 billion, also acquired a third property at 28 Indian Creek Island Road. In all, he spent\n$234 million\nfor the three Indian Creek properties.",

Oza owns the home next door.\nOza, a recurring guest investor on the reality TV show Shark Tank, was a former chief marketing officer for Glaceau, the parent company of Smartwater and Vitaminwater, which sold to Coca-Cola for $4.2 billion in 2007, according to published reports. He paid\n$13.5 million\nfor the property adjacent to the Sapirs in December.\nEvan Weiss of 305 Degrees Realty represented Oza in the two deals. He did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0Attorney\u00a0Michael Gallinar\u00a0with Adams Gallinar also represented Oza.\nThe home at 206 West San Marino Drive was marketed as a teardown. The 4,300-square-foot house sits on a 0.2-acre lot and was built in 1955. A trust in Yanina Sapir\u2019s name paid just over $11 million for the property in December 2021.\n\nOza likely plans to knock down both of his homes and build a larger estate. The two lots total 0.6 acres.\nAlex Sapir\n, who is dating actress and TV host Leila Ben Khalifa, developed the boutique luxury condo Arte in Surfside. Sapir heads the Sapir Organization and Sapir Corp., both based in New York. He is expected to next work on a major mixed-use development near Edgewater and the Arts &amp; Entertainment District in Miami.\nA filing in the Sapirs\u2019 divorce states that a marital property was under contract as of mid-January, and was set to close a few weeks from then. But it did not name the property. The couple\u2019s estate is estimated to be valued at more than $100 million, filings show. A trial on the divorce is set for later this year.\nThe Sapirs also own the waterfront mansion at 126 West San Marino Drive, on the opposite side of 206 West San Marino. Together, the two homes hit the market\nfor $54 million\nwith Luxe Living Realty owner/broker Dora Puig after Yanina filed for divorce in 2022. On its own, the house at 206 West San Marino Drive that just sold was previously asking $12.9 million.\nNearby on Di Lido Island, progressive heir Daniel Lewis recently sold his waterfront spec home\nfor $19.5 million\n, adding to a string of pricey deals on the Venetian Islands.",

        "content": "After a stressful first season for Shohei Ohtani with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the baseball superstar is plotting a project in Hawaii where he can lay his head during the offseason.\nOhtani is designing a 5,000-square-foot home in Hapuna Estates, a gated community within the Mauna Key Resort on the Big Island, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Ohtani is the first known resident of the luxury community and will reside on an acre overseeing the eighth hole of a golf course.\nThe deal was first reported by Sportskeeda.\nIt\u2019s not clear what Ohtani paid for the site and it\u2019s possible he\u2019s benefiting from how he\u2019s already being used to market the community. Ohtani was able to choose his lot and the developers, led by California-based West Point Investment Corp., will oversee construction to the two-way player\u2019s specifications.\nLots at Hapuna Estates will start around $4.9 million. The community will span 34 acres and contain 66 luxury homes \u2014 a portion in a 14-home subdivision where prices will range between $16 million and $20 million \u2014 and duplex condos. Construction is slated to start this year.\n\nKingsbarn Realty Capital is a partner on the subdivision, while Dominis Holdings is a partner on the condos. Hapuna Realty\u2019s Tomo Matsumoto is leading sales across the project.\nThe resort features two golf courses, private beaches and hotels.\nThose concerned about the Japanese superstar\u2019s ability to pay for the home need not worry. Ohtani\u2019s historic $700 million contract with the Dodgers includes $680 million in deferred payments, meaning he\u2019s only making $2 million annually over the next ten years. But he makes approximately $45 million annually in endorsements.\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the alleged theft committed by Ohtani\u2019s longtime interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara. He\u2019s accused of stealing $16 million from Ohtani to place bets with an illegal bookmaker. He\u2019s been charged with bank fraud by federal prosecutors; Ohtani hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing, but the situation has cast a dark shadow over the start of his season.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

He finally took it off the market in November of last year.\nCasa Blanca\u2019s Hannah Bomze brought the anonymous buyer.\n\nThe modern, Thad Hayes-designed apartment sits atop a limestone mansion designed by C.P.H Gilbert in 1904. The 50-foot-wide mansion contains seven condo units. The penthouse has three beds and three full baths, as well as 2,800 square feet of outdoor space.\nThe top floor has a screening room and game room; the second level features a terrace that looks out onto Central Park, while the lowest floor has the primary bedroom with south-facing windows and another terrace. The middle floor contains an open-concept great room, eat-in kitchen and access to the terrace.\nIn the most recent StreetEasy listing, the home was also listed to rent for $75,000 per month.\nLast May, Chanos also sold his\nSouth Beach condo for $17.8 million\nafter buying it for $3.1 million in 2003.\nThe selloffs come after Chanos announced in 2023 that he was winding down his famed hedge fund, which he ran for nearly four decades. The fund saw its AUM shrink to less than $200 million from the $6 billion it managed in 2008, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nChanos\u2019 claim to fame was pointing to irregularities in gas-pipeline company Enron\u2019s public filings in 2001. That same year, the hyped energy firm imploded, filing for bankruptcy in one of the most notorious examples of corporate fraud in history.\nThe short seller also bet correctly on the financial crisis of 2008-09, but in recent years struggled to turn profits on his short positions against electric car maker Tesla while the market for bear trading has dried up.\n",

        "content": "One of the East Side\u2019s vaunted co-ops has added a new resident.\nUnit 12 at 960 Fifth Avenue traded hands for $53.5 million on Tuesday, according to public records. The sale for the prewar unit, which\nhit the market in May 2023 for $70 million\n, also included two staff rooms on the third floor of the property that also uses the address 3 East 77th Street.\n.\nThe apartment has eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms, five wood-burning fireplaces and 11- to 13-foot ceilings. The 10 windows in the 12th-floor home face Fifth Avenue with views of Central Park.\nThe buyer is hidden in a trust, part of an\nincreasingly accepted convention\nof buyer anonymity from the notoriously nosy properties.\nThe seller is the estate of former oil heiress Anne Hendricks Bass, who died in 2020.\nThe Rosario Candela-designed building comes with a private restaurant, in-house chef, rooftop fitness center and rooftop terrace.\n\nThe original listing price would have put the apartment in the rarified $70 million bucket of co-op sales.\nOne of the penthouse units at the Lenox Hill building broke the record for the most expensive co-op ever sold when it went for\n$70 million to Nassef Sawiris\n, Egypt\u2019s richest man, in 2014. That record stood for just three months before a duplex at\n740 Park Avenue sold for $71.3 million\nto billionaire Israel \u201cIzzy\u201d Englander.\nAs it stands, the sale of Unit 12 is the most expensive co-op sale so far this (barely two-week-old) year. The 30 percent discount from listing to closed price is emblematic of the state of the co-op market: In the fourth quarter last year, co-op median sales prices fell almost 8 percent year-over-year, according to data from Miller Samuel.\nThe 12-story building has housed a number of residents from notable families, including more recent additions of the\nheir to the Est\u00e9e Lauder fortune\nand a\nmember of the wealthy Colombian family\nthat controls brewing giant SABMiller.\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert had the listing.\nLast year, Lambert moved another co-op in a celebrated building just a few doors down, selling Barbara Walters\u2019 11-room apartment at 944 Fifth Avenue for\n$15 million\n.\nThe buyer was an entity tied to former Disney president Michael Ovitz and his partner, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon.\n",

        "content": "UPDATED MAY 9 at 1:30 p.m.:\nA Los Angeles lawsuit entangles a television producer, a city with deep pockets and a Brentwood home once owned by Marilyn Monroe, whose life ended in a back bedroom.\nReal estate heiress Brinah Milstein Bank of the Milstein Properties family in New York and her husband, reality TV producer Roy Bank, have sued the City of Los Angeles for their alleged right to bulldoze a Spanish hacienda-style home at 12305 5th Helena Drive,\nBusiness Insider reported\n.\nThe Banks bought the first and last home owned by the Hollywood siren in July for\n$8.35 million.\nThey bought the house next door, a 6,000-square-foot dwelling at 12306 6th Helena Drive, in 2016 for $8.2 million.\nBut their plans to raze the 2,900-square-foot Monroe home to make room to expand their house next door created an international outcry \u2014 and an order by the city to temporarily stave off the wrecking ball.\nDays after\nreports surfaced\nthat the century-old home faced demolition, the Los Angeles City Council in September rushed through a motion to consider\ndesignating the property a historic cultural monument\n, a move that would invalidate the demolition permits.\nThe City Council will vote on whether to declare the house a historic cultural monument by mid-June.\nIn a written statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, Milstein and Bank\u2019s attorney Peter Sheridan alleged the city \u201cengaged in an illegal and unconstitutional conspiracy\u201d involving government officials and tour operators and violated the law \u201cwith regards to the quasi-judicial process required for evaluation of alleged historic cultural monuments.\u201d\nMonroe bought the one-story, four-bedroom home in early 1962 for $77,500 \u2014 or roughly $790,000 in 2023 dollars \u2014 after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller. Less than six months later, the 36-year-old actress was found dead from a drug overdose in her bedroom.\nIts front step tiles read \u201cCursum Perficio\u201d \u2014 Latin for \u201cmy journey ends here.\u201d\n\nThe Banks contend the house has been \u201csubstantially altered\u201d since Monroe\u2019s death, according to their complaint.\n\u201cThere is not a single piece of the house that includes any physical evidence that Ms. Monroe ever spent a day at the house, not a piece of furniture, not a paint chip, not a carpet, nothing,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe Banks claim they were issued a demolition permit from the city, which was initially \u201cheld\u201d for 30 days to allow for objections.\nNo objections were raised and permits were subsequently issued, they say, which led to them incurring more than $30,000 in expenses before receiving an actual notice of a \u201cstay\u201d invoked by the city.\nTheir lawsuit also alleges that the city\u2019s push for the designation violated its own codes, which has deprived the plaintiffs of their \u201cvested rights as owners of real property\u201d and has caused them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d\nLiz Waytkus, the U.S. executive director of the conservation nonprofit Docomomo, told\nDezeen\nlast month that the demolition highlighted a \u201csystemic\u201d problem in the area.\n\u201cThe land has become more valuable than the house, and even if people understand the value of such a home, location and land value often trump architectural significance,\u201d she said.\nCorrection: Previous story incorrectly identified Milstein and Bank.\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew\n",

He owned the unit for decades, but his need for it likely waned after John wrapped up his worldwide farewell tour.\nIt\u2019s remarkable John is still standing after being blown away by the anonymous purchaser\u2019s offer. John listed the unit only a few weeks ago, asking $5 million for the condo. He received a 45 percent premium on the listing price in a deal that works out to roughly $535 per square foot.\nJohn initially purchased a 2,500-square-foot duplex in the building in 1992 before tacking on five apartments over the succeeding years. The 40-story building has 256 units in total.\nThe 13,500-square-foot, four-bedroom unit generated plenty of interest right away, according to the\nlisting\nagent. Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Chase Mizell said the local buyer paid in cash. Mizell added the apartment was deliberately underpriced in the hope buyers would bid the price up.\n\nThe unit includes a gym, massage room and a unique floorplan. There are large open spaces that John used to showcase his photography collection. It\u2019s unclear if the buyer has their own collection of art, but there\u2019s certainly room to display it. The deal also comes with nine reserved parking spaces, six private storage units and five wine storage units.\nAtlanta Fine Homes Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Betsky Akers represented the buyer.\nTwo years ago, John and his husband David Furnish\npaid $8.5 million\nfor the property adjacent to their longtime, $7.3 million home in Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills. They bought a 20-acre estate in Bel Air for $33 million in 2015 and previously owned two condo units at the Sierra Towers in West Hollywood.\nThe couple also owns properties in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The new deed has yet to register in public records and the buyer is unknown.\nChristian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate represented both the buyer and seller in the deal.\nThe five-time Grammy Award winner and \u201cUptown Girl\u201d and \u201cPiano Man\u201d singer is a longtime South Florida resident. In 2006, he flipped a waterfront Miami Beach house for\n$3.6 million\n.\n\nHe bought the Manalapan estate for $22.1 million in 2015, records show. Built in 2010 on 1.6 acres, the mansion spans nearly 13,400 square feet, according to property records. It has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a theater, pub room and library, according to records and the listing. The estate includes a two-bedroom guest house, a 12-car garage, a pool and 150 feet of frontage on both the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, the listing shows.\nJoel first listed the estate for\n$31.9 million\nin 2018.

It returned to the market in January asking $54.9 million, and the asking price got a haircut to $49.9 million in March.\nEarlier this year, reports speculated that Joel was likely the hidden buyer in the January purchase of a waterfront Boca Raton mansion for\n$29 million\n, which briefly held the title of the city\u2019s priciest home.\nAgents say demand has picked up for luxury homes in\nManalapan\n, many of which have the benefit of water frontage on both the ocean and Intracoastal Waterway, allowing homeowners beach access and dock facilities for their boats. Manalapan estates are larger and less expensive than comparable homes in nearby Palm Beach.\nMany say Manalapan is poised for new prominence in South Florida\u2019s ultra-luxury sector. Billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison\ndropped $277.4 million\non the town\u2019s Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa in August and is set to open a Nobu restaurant there in the coming months, according to published reports.\nJoel, for his part, is looking to unload some of his most significant real estate holdings.

        "content": "Ye, the rapper and music producer formerly known as Kanye West, has found a possible buyer for his unfinished Malibu home, making it last week\u2019s top property under contract in the Los Angeles County luxury residential market.\nThe beachfront home has been up for sale since January, when it was listed for $53 million. In April, the Tadao Ando-designed house was\nreduced\nto $39 million. A restoration will be required by the next owner, given the home has been stripped of all interior finishes, according to the listing from The Oppenheim Group\u2019s Jason Oppenheim.\nThe home is roughly 4,000 square feet with four bedrooms and five baths. It\u2019s made of about 1,200 tons of concrete and 200 tons of steel reinforcement, the listing said.\nYe\u2019s property at 24844 Malibu Road was the largest contract inked between July 22 and July 28, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report LA. The Eklund-Gomes report counts all signed contracts in the MLS listed above $4 million in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe Malibu Road house is one of 16 total signed contracts for the week ended July 28, which is down from 19 in the prior week. The 16 contracts reflect single-family deals with total volume of $136.6 million, which is up slightly from the prior week\u2019s $132 million.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest contract is 543 Perugia Way in Holmby Hills, listed at $13.7 million. The five-bed, seven-bath home totals 9,615 square feet and sits on more than half an acre.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Linda May and Guy Levy have the listing. The seller is a trust tied to philanthropist couple Dr. Rafael Mendez and his wife Sharyl Mendez, according to property records.\nThe Tudor-style home built in 1932 has views of the Bel-Air Country Club Golf Course. It first hit the market for $17.5 million in October.\n",

        "content": "Retired Yankee shortstop turned real estate investor Alex Rodriguez sold a waterfront lot on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island back to billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nRodriguez\n, chairman and CEO of Miami-based A-Rod Corp, sold the nearly 1-acre property at 14 Star Island Drive back to the Citadel founder and CEO for $45.5 million, according to sources. Rodriguez, who was first spotted on the island when he was engaged to Jennifer Lopez, planned to hire a world-renowned architect to design a 20,000-square-foot mansion on the lot.\nGriffin\nhad acquired the property in 2020 for $24 million, then sold the lot to Rodriguez a year ago for $18.5 million, records show. But that price alone is likely misleading. The property was part of a land swap between the two that included the adjacent estate at 13 Star Island Drive, sources said. Rodriguez and Lopez\npaid $32.5 million\nfor that estate in 2020. Griffin now controls both.\nThe sales of those properties were brokered by Jill Hertzberg and Jill Eber of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker; Rodriguez\u2019s sister, Arlene Susy Dunand; and Ryan Mendell of Maxwelle Real Estate.\nGriffin has been assembling land on\nStar Island\n, a man-made island just off of the MacArthur Causeway in Miami Beach, since 2020. He also collected residential properties in Palm Beach over the last decade-plus. On a piece of his Palm Beach assemblage, he is building a waterfront estate for his mother. His Citadel and Citadel Securities relocated from Chicago to Miami, where Griffin plans a waterfront\nsupertall commercial tower\nin Brickell where both sister companies will be based.\n\nThe latest deal with Rodriguez gives Griffin nearly 6.5 acres of contiguous land on Star Island. That\u2019s larger than billionaire Phillip and Patricia Frost\u2019s estate at 21 Star Island Drive. And now just one other property owner stands between Griffin and the Frosts: Frayda Lindemann\u2019s home at 15 Star Island Drive. (Lindemann is the widow of billionaire businessman George Lindemann.)\nGriffin owns\n8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 Star Island Drive, which are on the west side of Star Island. He also paid about\n$107 million\nlast year for Adrienne Arsht\u2019s estate in Coconut Grove, where he proposed moving a historic structure off the property.\nOther recent deals on Star Island include Dentek founder John Jansheski\u2019s sale of his estate at 27 Star Island Drive for\n$57 million\nin September; and rapper\nRick Ross\n\u2019 purchase of 37 Star Island Drive for $35 million in August. Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, Lennar Corporation Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller, billionaire LoanDepot founder and CEO Anthony Hsieh and plastic surgeon Leonard Hochstein, also known as the \u201cBoob God,\u201d all own homes on the gated island.\nRodriguez, who lives near Coral Gables, has invested in a handful of developments in South Florida. His Monument Capital Management, which is part of the A-Rod Corp umbrella of companies, recently raised more than $75 million for a fifth multifamily fund that\u2019s expected to acquire $300 million in properties in the Sun Belt and Midwestern U.S.\n",

It sold on March 5 in an apparent off-market deal for $1.18 million less.\nThe two-story, red-tiled mansion, built in 2010, has a double-height foyer with a curved wooden staircase and white tiled floors. There\u2019s a luxury kitchen, multiple living rooms, a formal dining room and a laundry room.\n\nThe home comes with two offices, a movie theater, a wet bar and a meditation room. There\u2019s also a bonus room that could be turned into a wine cellar, kid\u2019s playroom or home gym, according to Realtor.com.\nThe kitchen has a marble center island, wood cabinets, a walk-in pantry and a breakfast nook. A formal dining room has a coffered ceiling and doors that open to the backyard. Sitting areas have stone fireplaces, beamed ceilings and wooden shutters.\nThe master bedroom has a wall of windows, a spa-style bathroom with a center tub, two walk-in closets and a laundry room.\nOutside, there\u2019s a resort-style pool with a Baja step, a rock slide grotto and a waterfall, plus a Jacuzzi, fire pit and patios surrounded by gardens, with a four-car garage. The monthly HOA fee is $725.\nBrokers Charisse Okamoto and Carrie English of Caliber Real Estate held the listing.\nShady Canyon features 300 homes on nearly 1,100 acres. The large lots coupled with a sense of privacy has prompted athletes, executives and others to call Shady Canyon home, including best-selling author Dean Koontz and Alteryx Executive Chairman Dean Stoecker.\nPujols, a native of the Dominican Republic, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1999, and went on to play for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the L.A.

        "content": "Kevin\u2019s Garnett\u2019s $16 million Malibu home sale has turned out to be anything but a slam dunk.\nThree years since the NBA Hall of Famer reached an agreement to sell the property to Hacopian Design &amp; Development, the deal is mired in legal scuffles over payments and blame for the soured trade.\nThe property at the center of the dispute sits on about 7 acres at 27715 Pacific Coast Highway. Garnett sold it partially completed.\nNow, as a two-year-old lawsuit against the buyer winds its way through Los Angeles Superior Court, a new complaint was filed in June against the title and escrow companies involved in the transaction.\nUnder terms of the 2021 sale, buyer Ando Hacopian of Hacopian Design &amp; Development Group agreed to handle Garnett\u2019s closing costs and any prior liens. Meanwhile, Garnett was expected to walk away with $6 million, including $2 million in cash at closing. An LLC managed by Garnett would carry two, $2 million notes. One was secured at 7 percent interest and would sit junior to an $11 million loan provided by Marquee Funding Group. The second note was unsecured and payable after the property was completed and resold, according to the purchase agreement submitted with court documents.\nGarnett\u2019s lawsuit against the title and escrow companies alleges Hacopian is a \u201cfraudster of the highest order\u201d and that Closing Agents Escrow and its CEO, along with First American Title Company, turned a blind eye to the alleged fraud.\nClosing Agents Escrow CEO Judith Sender, a spokesperson for First American Title and Hacopian \u2013\u2013 who is the defendant in a separate lawsuit brought by Garnett \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.\nGarnett claims Hacopian said half of the $2 million due at closing was required to be held in escrow, according to the most recent lawsuit.\n\u201cThe fact is, Hacopian did not have the necessary funds to close and lied to induce me to close rather than to call a default,\u201d Garnett said in a declaration last year for the separate dispute against the buyer.\n\nGarnett goes on to say a statement provided as proof of a $5.5 million balance for Hacopian was later confirmed through a subpoena with a balance of $50.\nAttorneys for Garnett in the latest lawsuit allege Hacopian duped a second party in VIG Private Lending, which agreed to finance a secondary $2 million loan toward the purchase price in exchange for nearly $4 million in cash at closing. The agreement pushed Garnett\u2019s note to a third deed of trust position, which the basketball star contends occurred without his knowledge.\nWhen Hacopian allegedly defaulted on the VIG loan, the lender foreclosed, triggering the loss of Garnett\u2019s unsecured note.\nHacopian said in his own declaration last year he was under the impression that if he found financing to pay VIG, the property would be sold back to him.\n\u201cI put all potential deals that I had been working on aside and focused on this project once again with the understanding that if I held my end of the bargain so would the foreclosing lender,\u201d Hacopian\u2019s declaration said.\nHe went on to claim he found financing in late 2022, but VIG \u201cwent silent.\u201d\nUltimately, attorneys for Garnett argue in the latest lawsuit the alleged fraud would not have worked without the escrow and title companies being \u201cinvolved in this entire charade.\u201d\nThe latest lawsuit seeks to-be-determined damages, including interest and attorney fees.\n",

Other features include a detached pool building, more than 100 acres of irrigated grounds, a 2-acre pond, and a 15-acre island in the Rogue River.\nDeVries said it\u2019s a rare opportunity to own a piece of the coveted Rogue Valley.\nDuffy also has listed a house, covered arena and barn on 29.5 acres, a chalet-style cabin on 2.18 acres, and a manufactured home on 5 acres, all located on Trails End Lane. A non-farm homesite on 12.45 acres was sold in June 2023.\nProspective buyers must register to bid with a $100,000 deposit and a letter of reference from their bank or financial institution. The highest bidder is responsible for a premium and any transfer fees, while the seller covers title search, title insurance, and broker commissions. Property details and diligence documents are available on ConciergeAuctions.com or by contacting 212-202-2940.\nDuffy, who acquired the property in 1990, describes the ranch as having \u201cseveral different worlds,\u201d and said he hoped it will find an owner who appreciates its distinct charm.\n\u2014Ted Glanzer\n",

        "content": "The creator of the Jack Reacher series is moving to the Upper West Side.\nBritish author James Dover Grant \u2014 known for penning the adventure novels under the name Lee Child \u2014 paid $17 million, or $2,215 per square foot, for a townhouse at 25 West 88th Street, according to public records.\nThe sellers, real estate investment banker Kurt Roeloffs and his wife Shyanne, bought the five-story home for $5.4 million in 2011. At the time, it was configured as a multifamily property with a quadraplex and four one-bedroom units.\nSince then, the couple underwent a significant renovation to combine the units into a single-family home sprawling 8,000 square feet, six bedrooms and six bathrooms. As part of the renovation, the two added a high-speed elevator and updates to the home\u2019s facade, including a new stoop.\nThe Roeloffs partnered with Baxt/Ingui Architects to convert the home into a LEED-certified\npassive house\ndesigned to reduce energy consumption and enhance air quality. The home is outfitted with hospital-grade air filters, solar panels and triple-filtration water system.\n\u201cThe point was to do a renovation that was more sustainable, highly effective and that didn\u2019t make any compromises,\u201d Shyanne Roeloffs said.\nShe added that the purpose was to reduce construction waste, which included donating appliances and sourcing materials locally. The backyard fence was constructed using some of the home\u2019s original materials as well as recycled wood from the Coney Island boardwalk.\nThe landmarked brownstone, built in 1889, also features a 500-bottle wine cellar, a terrace with an outdoor fireplace, a yoga, dance and entertainment studio and an eat-in kitchen.\n\nThe listing describes the home as \u201c\ntriple mint\n,\u201d which means its kitchen, bathroom and overall condition are pristine, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan wrote in Forbes in 2018.\nRoeloffs said the couple invested heavily in the renovation with expectations to stay in the home for years, but they ultimately chose to move to the U.K. to pursue higher education opportunities and to be closer to family.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shame to have put so much heart and soul into a place,\u201d Roeloffs said.\nThe Roeloffs first listed the home for $19 million in 2016 before pulling it off the market and relisting it for $17.5 million in 2021. The townhouse hit the market again last April with an asking price of $18 million.\nLeslie J. Garfield\u2019s Richard Pretsfelder and Thomas Wexler had the listing.\nRenovated townhouses are the market\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d right now, though there aren\u2019t many of them on the market, according to Pretsfelder. He added that though activity in the neighborhood has been strong, he\u2019s expecting transactions to continue to pick up.\nKurt Roeloffs is the former head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s real estate investment banking arm in Asia. He now serves as the global chief investment officer of RREEF and as the chairman of Seaforth Land, a London-based developer focused on restoring commercial real estate in the city.\nShyanne Roeloffs is a PhD candidate studying the psychology of hunger at Anglia Rustin University in Cambridge.\n",

The platform ranked the series among the top 10 TV shows worldwide for a week and among the top 10 in the country for two weeks.

Glaser then approached Holzer about splitting the property.\n\u201cShe thought it was a great idea,\u201d he said. He thought about buying the property himself, he said, but decided it was \u201coverkill.\u201d\nNow he plans to add a guest house and a garden on the east side of his combined properties.\nBuying up neighboring properties\nhas become a common practice in South Florida\u2019s luxury market, where wealthy buyers often cobble together two, three or more lots to assemble larger estates.",

In the Hamptons, new listings increased 41 percent annually, rising from 92 to 130, while new signed contracts remained stagnant between the two periods.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

Months earlier, Bezos\npaid $68 million\nfor the adjacent mansion.

Leibovitz purchased the unit at the Brentmore at 88 Central Park West\nfor $11.3 million\nin 2014.\nThe unit is 3,500 square feet, breaking down an asking price of $2,457 per square foot.\nThe UWS unit has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. It\u2019s on the fifth and sixth floors of the 12-story building, which has been the home to celebrities including Robert De Niro, Paul Simon and Sting.\nThe pad overlooks Central Park, a motivator when Leibovitz first saw the apartment a decade ago.

The Corcoran Group\u2019s Deborah Kern has the\nlisting\n.\n\nLeibovitz told the outlet she is ready to move on because her children are out of school and her work is downtown; last year, she purchased a full-floor condo in the West Village for\n$6.5 million\n. Her family home, meanwhile, is upstate in Rhinebeck.\nThe downtown and Upstate properties were the subject of a nonpayment lawsuit against Leibovitz with in 2009.

        "content": "Sitting on the couch in the staged living room of the Tarpon Island estate in Palm Beach, Todd Michael Glaser seemed befuddled.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why Tarpon hasn\u2019t sold yet,\u201d the spec developer said in February, shaking his head as he mused about the market between calls.\nTarpon is a 21,400-square-foot renovated megamansion, with 11 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, two kitchens, a home office, tennis court, gym, salon and spa, two pools, a hot tub and cold plunge, sitting on a 2.3-acre private island. It has room to fit staff, in-laws, a catering team and more. It should check all the boxes for the typical ultra-rich homebuyer.\nIn 2021, Glaser and his partners, Jim Randall, Scott Robins and Jonathan Fryd, bought the private island for\n$85 million\n. A year later they listed it for\n$218 million\n, with grandiose visions.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a house for Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d Glaser told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time. After an unsuccessful first season, it returned to the market at the reduced price of $187.5 million.\nGlaser\u2019s luck changed about a month ago, when Tarpon went into contract. The sale is expected to close soon, and it will mark one of the priciest ever in Florida.\nIt also signifies the true start of the region\u2019s busiest season. After a string of record years during the pandemic that were followed by a dropoff in sales, South Florida agents say this season is delayed and inconsistent, but\ndefinitely still better\nthan other top luxury markets. Price cuts are spurring sales, as buyers are expected to jump into the market as summer approaches.\n\u201cWe got a late start is really what it comes down to,\u201d said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been some momentum, but it ebbs and flows very oddly.\u201d\nAs price reductions have become more common, the pricing gap between buyers and sellers of ultra-luxury homes in South Florida has narrowed, resulting in a boost in activity at the very high end over the last two-plus months. Each deal creates momentum for the next. But inventory is still wonky, agents say.\nHousing analyst Jonathan Miller said the luxury market is in a \u201cslow grind.\u201d Pricing has fallen, but it\u2019s still up, compared to pre-pandemic. High interest rates and elevated pricing are keeping sales below pandemic highs. And the upcoming election and slow summer season suggest the boost in activity could be short-lived.\nIn Miami Beach and other barrier island markets including Bal Harbour and Indian Creek, 10 luxury single-family home sales closed in the first quarter, up 25 percent from eight sales during the same period of last year, according to the Miller-authored\nDouglas Elliman reports\n. Still, the median price for luxury homes fell 28 percent to just over $13 million. The reports define luxury as the top 10 percent of deals. Inventory and months of supply also rose.\nIn Palm Beach, the overall number of single-family home sales and their median price each rose in the same time period. Isolating the top 10 percent of the market, luxury home and condo sales fell 10 percent to nine closings; and the median price fell 18 percent to $14 million.\n\u201cPart of this decline is attributable to a shift in the mix, in terms of what\u2019s selling. Even though the median price is down, it\u2019s still \u2026 higher than pre-pandemic,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe numbers are still elevated, but choppy.\u201d\nMarket movers\nSouth Florida\u2019s major luxury deals were concentrated in Palm Beach and Miami Beach this season, though a handful of sales scattered across South Florida\u2019s waterways are still setting records.\nEven sales of vacant lots have picked up. Those deals are often more challenging because of the cost and time associated with building. Dora Puig, top broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, said teardowns and land sales are being \u201creally negotiated.\u201d\nIn April, billionaire Barry Diller\npaid $45 million\nfor the 1.5-acre waterfront lot at 5930 North Bay Road, a record for the waterfront Miami Beach street. Nearby, an assemblage of waterfront land at 18 La Gorce Circle, asking $132 million, is in contract to two buyers after the price was reduced twice from the original $170 million asking price. Both of those deals include homes that the buyers are expected to tear down and replace with new mansions.\nBuyers are looking at the usual areas: the Sunset and Venetian islands, North Bay Road, La Gorce, Star Island and Indian Creek, said top Douglas Elliman agent Dina Goldentayer.\nDiller\u2019s buy and billionaire Teddy Sagi\u2019s pending\n$24 million purchase\nof a teardown at 4521 Pine Tree Drive show that buyers are willing to spend big money on vacant lots again.\n\u201cTwo big sales is enough for everyone to be excited,\u201d Goldentayer said.\nIn another private island deal, billionaire Jeff Bezos\ndropped $90 million\non a third waterfront Indian Creek Village estate in March. The Amazon founder had been in the market for a home he could live in while he has a mansion built on a double lot on the island that he assembled last year for nearly $150 million.\nThe activity has spilled over to condos, too. In Surfside, a penthouse at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club\nsold for $44 million\n, a record $6,000 per square foot.\n\nGoldentayer sees consistent demand for properties priced at $20 million and up.\n\u201cThe demand continues [for] uber-wealthy new residents re-domiciling, and they want something special,\u201d she said.\nBrokers say they\u2019re seeing multiple buyers expressing interest, especially following a price cut, but not necessarily pulling the trigger.\n\u201cIn each of those markets, there seems to be a good number of buyers,\u201d said Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, who is representing the seller in the pending La Gorce deal. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll overpay.\u201d\nAside from Tarpon Island, big Palm Beach deals include Nvidia board member Harvey Jones\u2019\n$74.3 million purchase\nof a 1-acre lakefront estate, which closed in March. Earlier this month, a hidden buyer\ndropped $85 million\nto acquire Ideavillage founder Anand Khubani\u2019s oceanfront 1-acre lot at 108 El Mirasol.\nThe deals that have closed are spurring more activity, agents say.\n\u201cIt churns the soil up underneath, it electrifies things,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Chris Leavitt, who is co-listing Tarpon Island. Pricey listings selling can \u201cgive the property down the street a little boost.\u201d\nLuxury lurkers\nProspective buyers are keeping a close eye on homes they\u2019re interested in \u2014 sometimes by boat. When some such trophy properties go into contract, those who missed out want to be notified if the deal falls through.\nThey\u2019re \u201ca little bit nervous, waiting and hesitating and losing the property they want,\u201d Hertzberg said. \u201cBut at the same time we\u2019re not back to [the buying frenzy of] 2021.\u201d\nMiller referred to these buyers as \u201cluxury lurkers.\u201d They want to buy, but feel less urgency.\nPuig said she has a waitlist of nine buyers who want to see her $80 million listing at 4736 North Bay Road, a waterfront estate under construction that developer Niklas de la Motte was building for himself.\nNelson Gonzalez, a top agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, said \u201chuge demand\u201d still exists. \u201cIt\u2019s just the very high-end buyers thinking the market is going to come down.\u201d\nSome properties are selling at record prices, and some are experiencing price cuts.\nAfter a year on the market\nasking $200 million\n, cosmetics heir William Lauder slashed the price for two oceanfront lots in Palm Beach. Rather than sell them together, he\u2019s now looking for two buyers at $88.9 million each. He also tapped Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate to take over the listing from Premier Estate Properties\u2019 Jim McCann.\nAt the end of the day, the asking price is a test.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over the board. I have denied some listings because of the seller\u2019s desired asking price. I don\u2019t want to waste my time or theirs,\u201d said Elliman agent Samantha Curry. \u201cThere\u2019s also some sellers that will say \u2018I don\u2019t know where the market is, so let\u2019s try this number.\u2019\u201d\nBrokers expect they\u2019ll have a little more time to find the sweet spot on pricing this season. Given the slow start and recent burst of activity, deals could keep closing past Memorial Day.\n\u201cI anticipate this season trending later this year,\u201d said Premier Estate Properties agent Margit Brandt, who is representing the buyer in the pending Tarpon Island deal. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot of closings in June and July.\u201d\nEven with the extension, buyers and sellers are still rushing to get deals done before they head to their summer homes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a major push right now,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a scurry to purchase before people leave.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Carl Westcott had just had surgery and was high on painkillers when he inked a contract to sell his Montecito home to singer Katy Perry and her husband, actor Orlando Bloom, for $15 million.\nThat\u2019s the crux of a three-year-legal dispute that goes to trial this month to settle ownership of the 9,300-square-foot estate at 1569 East Valley Road,\nthe Daily Mail reported.\nWestcott\u2019s lawyers argue the contract to sell his home is \u201cvoidable\u201d because of their client\u2019s mental state. His family is now fighting the singer for control of their father\u2019s $15 million estate.\nIn July 2020, the then 80-year-old military veteran with Huntington\u2019s Disease said he had just undergone a six-hour back surgery and had taken opiates to numb the pain.\n\u201cThe combination of his age, frailty from his back condition and recent surgery, and the opiates he was taking several times a day rendered Mr. Westcott of unsound mind,\u201d according to a lawsuit.\nThree days after he was released from the hospital, Bernie Gudvi, who represented Perry and Bloom, presented Westcott with a written offer for more than he had paid two months earlier for the eight-bedroom, 11-bath estate, according to his complaint.\nThe following day, Westcott signed a sales agreement prepared by Berkshire Hathaway.\nThe deal, reported at the time for\n$14.2 million\n, included a four-building compound in the Santa Ynez foothills built in the 1930s, then renovated by architect Lutah Maria Riggs. For Perry, born and raised in Santa Barbara, it was supposed to be a homecoming.\n\nBut Westcott\u2019s lawyers argue the aging seller was \u201cunable to understand the nature and probable consequences of his actions.\u201d Days later, Westcott \u201cstarted to feel mentally clear again\u201d and realized the weight of his signature on the agreement, the complaint states.\nWestcott then sent an email to Berkshire Hathaway, which represented the seller and buyer, saying that he didn\u2019t want to sell \u2014 that he\u2019d been under the influence of pain medication and was \u201cin the final years of his life and cannot sell his home,\u201d the lawsuit contends.\nTwo days later, the Westcott received a letter from a lawyer for Gudvi, Perry and Bloom, saying the couple was \u201cnot willing to walk away from purchasing Mr. Westcott\u2019s home and he is obligated to complete the sale.\u201d\nWestcott, who served in the U.S. Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division, is an entrepreneur with roots in Texas who owned numerous companies, including 1-800-Flowers.\nPreviously, Perry ran into another legal bramble when she tried to buy an 8-acre Los Angeles convent for a future home.\nThe pop star spent roughly two years\nfighting a group of aging nuns\nand a competing wannabe buyer, restaurateur Dana Hollister, for the former Waverly Place convent at 3431 Waverly Drive. An 89-year-old nun\ndied in the courtroom\n.\nAfter spending\n$2.6 million in legal fees\n, Perry acquired the property in 2016, with damages totaling more than $15 million.\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew\n",

The Wall Street Journal\nfirst reported\nnews of the contract on Tuesday.\nThe six-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment last asked just under $23 million, according to a Streeteasy listing.

        "content": "\u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d star Lisa Hochstein found a new home in South Beach.\nHochstein is leasing a luxury condo on the second floor of One Ocean, a building the Related Group developed at\n1 Collins Avenue\nand completed in 2016, according to information from the Multiple Listing Service that matches images of the unit posted online.\nHochstein moved out of the\nStar Island\nmansion she previously shared with her soon-to-be ex-husband, plastic surgeon Lenny Hochstein, according to\nPage Six\n. She moved into the 5,600-square-foot unit with five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms.\nTatiana Everett, with the Abella Group at Compass, was the listing agent. She said the tenant signed a multi-year lease agreement for the space, which included the ability for Hochstein to film there.\nLisa Hochstein told\nThe Real Deal\nthat she decided on the condo, which she said was \u201cobviously beautiful,\u201d in part because her \u201csoon-to-be-ex wanted me and the kids to be very close to the Star Island mansion and close to school.\u201d\nLenny Hochstein is contributing $17,000 a month for the lease, Lisa said. She toured 30 to 40 homes in the three months she spent looking for a unit to lease. Asking prices for luxury rentals have skyrocketed in Miami Beach since the pandemic.\n\u201cWe were just having a really hard time getting a five-bedroom place very close in South Beach that feels like a house and didn\u2019t make me feel alienated from the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feel like the kids didn\u2019t want to stay with me.\u201d\nHochstein is living in the unit with her children and her boyfriend, Jody Glidden, who recently listed his waterfront home at\u00a0250 South Hibiscus Drive\u00a0for sale asking $14 million with Compass agent Eli Faitelson. Glidden \u201creally stepped up and helped contribute\u201d to Lisa\u2019s lease because Lenny Hochstein wouldn\u2019t contribute more than the $17,000 a month, according to a source.\n\nProperty records show an affiliate of Miami Beach-based Auckland Holdings paid $8.3 million for the unit in 2016. The company and other related entities own seven condos in the area.\nLisa and Lenny Hochstein have been going through a highly publicized divorce, which was featured on the most recent season of the reality TV show. Court records show Lenny filed an urgent motion in August to rescind the marital settlement agreement they had reached.\nHe paid $2 million for the home at 42 Star Island Drive in 2012. The couple tore down the previous home to build the three-story, 18,000-square-foot mansion that exists today.\nThe\nproperty\nwas at the center of drama between Lisa Hochstein and co-star Larsa Pippen. Pippen claimed that the Hochsteins were renting their house out for events and shoots to pay the mortgage.\nAlthough the divorce is not yet final, Lenny Hochstein is now engaged to model Katharina Mazepa.\nLisa Hochstein signed the lease at One Ocean in early September, according to the MLS.\nThe 46-unit condo building includes retail space on the ground floor. Last year, investor Robert Rivani\npaid $12.2 million\nfor a 13,500-square-foot commercial unit. Philippe by Philippe Chow recently signed a 15-year lease for the restaurant space.\n",

        "content": "Supermodel Elle Macpherson sold her mansion in Coral Gables for $18.5 million.\nBumda Trust, a hidden trust managed by an attorney, acquired the 8,935-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom home at 9550 Journeys End Road, property records show.\nMacpherson\npaid $8.1 million\nfor the 1.7-acre property in 2018. She listed it for sale two years ago\nfor $29 million\n. It was most recently asking $22 million, according to the listing. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Pablo Alfaro and Lourdes Alatriste were the listing agents. Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker represented the buyer.\nMacpherson, an actress and businesswoman, was\npreviously married\nto developer Jeffrey Soffer. They lived together in Indian Creek Village. She purchased the Journey\u2019s End estate one year after their divorce was finalized.\nThe Coral Gables home is not waterfront but it includes a boat slip at the Journey\u2019s End Marina. The property has a pool, home office, gym, a chef\u2019s kitchen, and primary suite. It was renovated in 2017, according to the listing.\n\nJourney\u2019s End is a gated, waterfront community near other gated neighborhoods in Coral Gables such as Gables Estates and Cocoplum.\nIn August, Francisco Unanue, a scion of the family that founded and runs Goya Foods, sold a waterfront lot in Gables Estates\nfor $18.5 million\nto a company managed by developer Alex Pirez.\nDespite price reductions, many homes are selling for more than their previous sale prices.\nIn July, the CEO of a San Francisco-based lending firm and his wife, a vegan cosmetics company founder, sold their Gables Estates mansion\nfor $27.5 million\n. They acquired the property in 2020 for $13.6 million.\n",

The house was asking $50,000 per month, according to a source.\nRachel Zackheim and Philip Scheinfeld of the Philip Scheinfeld Team at Compass represented the tenant.\nHardaway Jr., who is the son of NBA hall of famer and crossover-dribble marvel Tim Hardaway,\npaid about $9.2 million for the spec home in May 2022\n, a record for a non-waterfront property in the area.\nThe junior Hardaway attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School in Pinecrest and joined the NBA in 2013, with stints with the\u00a0 Knicks and the Atlanta Hawks before joining the Mavericks in 2019.\nDeveloper Todd Michael Glaser built Hardaway\u2019s 4,700-square-foot, six-bedroom home. Glaser and his partners, Fred Karlton and Charlie Ratner, paid about $1.5 million for the 9,400-square-foot lot in 2016 via 6015 NBR Partners LLC, property records show.\nThe property, designed by Domo Architecture + Design, has two pools, a two-car garage, a summer kitchen and garden. The second floor includes four bedrooms and a family room.\n\nEarlier this year,\nrents for high-end properties\nin the area were sky-high, but have since fallen, according to a source.\nIn 2021, Hardaway Jr. sold the waterfront home at 672 South Shore Drive on Miami Beach\u2019s Normandy Isle for $6.8 million.\nHardaway Jr. is hardly the only current or active NBA player making real estate moves in Miami recently.\nRetired basketball star Jason Richardson in September bought a flipped mansion in Miami.\nRichardson dropped $6.3 million on the 1.2-acre estate at 10010 Southwest 60th Street from Jeff Aririguzo, a source confirmed. Aririguzo is an e-commerce entrepreneur and influencer.\nJorge Uribe of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing, and Gisele Bonetti and Megan Clark of Coldwell Banker brought the buyer.\nRichardson had a 14-season career with the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors, Charlotte Bobcats, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers between 2001 and 2015. He was the fifth overall pick in the NBA draft in 2001.\n\u2014 Ted Glanzer, Katherine Kallergis",

She qualified for the competition by winning the Miss Maryland USA pageant in April.\nBy day, Mushinge manages leases for the U.S. Postal Service facilities, working on numerous deals from JLL\u2019s D.C. office. And she spends part of her life competing in scholarship competitions.\nThe upcoming Miss USA competition involves rehearsals, interviews with judges, social media and TV appearances, meet-and-greets, swimsuit and ballgown segments, and onstage questions. The final will be broadcast on the CW.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got various amazing women. And so you really have to know yourself and know what you\u2019re bringing to the table and what makes you stand out,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cAnd I think the most challenging part is really knowing who you are because I think the judges are going to be able to pick up on that very quickly.\u201d\nShe was born in Zambia and came to the U.S. when she was 13; her family\u2019s involvement in real estate, buying and flipping houses, sparked her interest in the field.\nNow, Mushinge aims to mentor others, especially women and people of color, to help diversify her profession.\n\nIn addition to her busy career and competing the Miss USA pageant, she serves as a health and wellness advocate for JLL, runs her charity, the Daughters Pride Foundation, and acts as a tourism ambassador for Zambia.\n\u201cI remember arriving to this country and the first thing that comes to mind is for whatever reason, it did not get dark,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cThe sun was out longer. It was 8:45 [p.m.], and it\u2019s still bright as day outside. And ever since that day, I feel being in this country, my life has only gotten brighter, has only gotten better.\u201d\nMushinge isn\u2019t the only real estate professional with an unusual, high-profile pursuit outside of work.\nMatija Pecotic, who is the director of capital markets for Wexford Real Estate Investors in Palm Beach, Florida, lived his dream in February when he took part in the\nDelray Beach Open tennis tournament\n.\nThe 33-year-old, who is ranked 784th in the world, ultimately fell in straight sets to No. 55 Marcos Giron, but not before creating some lifelong memories.\nHe got into the tournament as an alternate and a slot opened up. Earlier this year, he won three qualifying matches, including one over Jack Sock, who had once been ranked in the top 10 in the world and won the Delray Beach Open in 2017.\n\u201cHopefully this has shown that I can play at a high level,\u201d Pecotic told Bloomberg News. \u201cI\u2019ve actually never gotten a wild card to any event in my life \u2014 all my results have been meritocratic, so if this leads to opportunities at other big events, I would consider putting Wexford on pause, I wouldn\u2019t quit.\u201d\n\u2014 Ted Glanzer",

        "content": "Real estate has always been about keeping the bad guys out.\nIn other eras, castles had moats and cities had walls. Security and privacy look different today, but for the moguls, titans of industry and uber celebrities buying luxury real estate in South Florida, it remains just as important as it was for the rulers and aristocrats of the past.\nTake\nLionel Messi\n. News broke in July that the soccer superstar signed a contract with Inter Miami for $60 million a year, inspiring a feverish Messi-mania across the tri-county region. Few celebrity home purchases have been more closely watched than Messi\u2019s this summer. And everyone knew he would be focused on privacy and safety.\nMessi is no stranger to South Florida \u2013\u2013 he owns three condos in Sunny Isles Beach, including one at\nPorsche Design Tower\n, developed by Gil Dezer\u2019s Dezer Development. He also rented a waterfront house in Key Biscayne during Covid, but that came with challenges for the uber celebrity: Fans came by boat to his dock, and police shut down his street, which was public.\nThis time, Messi was looking for a private, gated community. He looked in\nSea Ranch Lakes\n, a tiny gated community that is walled in with its own police force and just over 200 homes. His teammate\nSergio Busquets\nbought a waterfront home there for $8.7 million.\nAfter a summer of wild speculation, Messi ultimately bought a waterfront mansion in another area, Bay Colony in Fort Lauderdale, for\n$10.8 million\n.\nJust across the water from Sea Ranch Lakes,\nBay Colony\noffers everything a security minded buyer would want. The gated luxury community has just over 100 lots, all of which are waterfront, and has round-the-clock security.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very, very tough about who comes in and out,\u201d Douglas Elliman agent Hedy Tufo told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile Messi is perhaps South Florida\u2019s most high-profile buyer in pursuit of privacy and security lately, brokers say the attributes are an increasingly common request from clients.\n\u201cSecurity and privacy [are] at the height of what people want,\u201d said Ruthie Assouline, an agent with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Assouline Team.\nBrokers say rising crime rates in other parts of the country are driving more security minded purchases in South Florida.\n\u201cThe reality is that when you have people who are so security conscious and moving from certain states, like New York and California, their eyes are very wide open to potential security issues,\u201d said Dana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach.\nKoch noted one of his clients recently bought a home in Bear\u2019s Club, the uber private, gated golf community in Jupiter designed by Jack Nicklaus. Residents include celebrity athletes Michael Jordan and Rory McIlroy, and the entire community has only 100 home sites.\nMany estates within Bear\u2019s Club have their own gates. The homeowners association picks up garbage and delivers mail and packages so as to limit outsiders\u2019 access. Guests are escorted to their final destination within the community by security guards.\nThis is what luxury buyers want, more and more, agents say.\n\n\u201cMore so than ever we have clients saying, \u2018We only want a gated community,\u2019\u201d Assouline said. \u201cThat makes people feel very secure in their home, knowing how closely everything is being watched.\u201d\nSouth Florida has an abundance of very secure communities with the cachet to attract high-profile buyers.\nIndian Creek\n, a private island in Biscayne Bay, is its own municipality, with its own police department. The village\u2019s streets are private, and access to the island is granted only to residents and their guests.\nWith that kind of security, the island has attracted the likes of\nJeff Bezos\n,\nTom Brady\n, and\nDavid Guetta\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s gated communities like La Gorce and Sunset Island, and there\u2019s private communities where they can actually deny access,\u201d said Nelson Gonzalez, an agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty. Because Indian Creek owns its streets, access can be denied to visitors, unlike other islands in Miami-Dade County, he said.\n\u201cEven Star Island, if you tell them you wanna drive around, they can\u2019t stop you,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\u201cA neighborhood that has its own police force is definitely preferred,\u201d said Jonathan Bigelman, an agent with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who noted many luxury buyers come with expensive collections of jewelry, wine and cars \u2014 assets that need protection as well as their families.\nFor those who don\u2019t go the route of gated or heavily patrolled single-family home communities, luxury condos also offer extensive security and privacy protection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer that security is an amenity [in condos],\u201d Bigelman said.\nAssouline noted that security and privacy depend on the development. Smaller, less social buildings are better for the uber private buyer, and a\nprivate restaurant\ncan make a big difference, she said.\nFisher Island\n, a private island off Miami Beach, is among the most secure condo enclaves in South Florida. The island is accessible only by ferry, boat or helicopter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way on, one way off,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cFisher Island is for sure very, very secure.\u201d\nJill Eber, an agent with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty, has lived on Fisher Island since 2000 and said the constant land and marine patrols of the island are a huge benefit to living there.\n\n\u201cI think security is a major draw here. People feel very comfortable,\u201d she said. Even the hotel on Fisher Island is invitation-only: Guests of the hotel must be sponsored by a resident.\nLuxury buyers keep flocking to secure communities for the sense of safety and refuge, Koch said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being in a bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel comfortable.\u201d",

The sellers bought the property in 2003 with $1.65 million.\nLaura Valente of Global Luxury Realty LLC represented B\u00fcndchen, while the listing agents were Chad Bishop and Saddy Abaunze Delgado of ONE Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe property has a 5,200-square-foot home and, in keeping with a sporty family \u2014 B\u00fcndchen has two children with Brady \u2014 two equestrian rings, a full soccer pitch, an infinity pool, outdoor kitchen and man-made pond with fish, the outlet says.\nThe town and surrounding area are known for being a big horse-riding community, Bishop told the outlet.\nBut the property will serve as more than a mini-sportsplex. B\u00fcndchen plans on having chickens and other farm animals, in addition to horses, on the property.\n\u201cThey will make it a real animal-friendly property,\u201d Bishop told the WSJ.\n\nBundchen is no stranger\nto owning property in South Florida\n.\nShe paid $11.5 million for the waterfront home at 1400 Biscaya Drive in Surfside in October 2022 via a trust, records show. The 6,600-square-foot house, built in 1981, is likely a teardown. It sits on a 0.4-acre lot across the water from the Indian Creek mansion that Brady is building.\nThe Surfside property has 92 feet of waterfront. The seller, Bay Drive BJ Partners LLC, lost money on the deal. It paid $11.8 million for the property months earlier, in April of last year.\nJoel Lusky with The Brokerage South Florida Real Estate represented the seller in the sale to B\u00fcndchen, according to Realtor.com. Vanessa Frank with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented B\u00fcndchen.\nRecords show that B\u00fcndchen, via an LLC, also paid $1.3 million for the small, non-waterfront home at 8850 Emerson Avenue in Surfside in February 2022, months before she and Brady announced their divorce. The deal may have introduced her to Frank of One Sotheby\u2019s, who was the listing agent for 8850 Emerson Avenue. The 1,540-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house, built in 1940, was renovated and sits on a 0.1-acre lot.\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen paid $17 million for the lot at\n26 Indian Creek Island Road\nin late 2020, via an LLC managed by Fontainebleau Development executives.\nThe couple knocked down the home on the nearly 2-acre property and began building a new mansion, which Brady continued after the couple\u2019s divorce, according to records.\n\u2014\u00a0Ted Glanzer",

The lawsuit demands a jury trial.\nSarandon\u2019s grievances extend beyond financial matters. She claims company owner Chad DeGrenier misrepresented his qualifications for the project and displayed inconsistencies in record-keeping and accounting. Sarandon and her family noticed construction issues during visits to the property in November 2022 and again in January 2023, the outlet said.\nSarandon commissioned an engineering report in February 2023. The report identified a range of problems, including mold growth, roofing defects, and insulation issues. The lawsuit points fingers at DeGrenier for poor contractor selection and management, citing instances of unqualified friends and family members being chosen for critical tasks.\nMoreover, the suit delves into an unrelated matter involving Chad DeGrenier\u2019s role as the property\u2019s caretaker. Despite allegedly receiving $140,000 for this responsibility, Sarandon claims that little actual caretaking took place. Instead, the lawsuit says, DeGrenier enriched himself by buying a $91,000 snowblower under his\u00a0 name.\n\u2014\nTed Glanzer",

Trump,\nthe New York Times reported\n.\nThe lien was filed due to Giuliani\u2019s outstanding income tax debt of approximately $550,000. This property is situated just three miles from Mar-a-Lago, the private club and residence of former President Trump.\nGiuliani and his ex-wife attempted to sell the condominium for $3.3 million in 2019 but were unsuccessful in finding a buyer. The existence of the IRS court filing came to light through a report by The Daily Mail. Giuliani\u2019s adviser, Ted Goodman, stated that Giuliani has a formal agreement with the IRS to address his tax debt.\nGiuliani faces multiple legal battles and mounting legal expenses related to his efforts to support Trump\u2019s bid to remain in office after the 2020 election. Among his legal challenges is a racketeering charge in Georgia for his role in that endeavor, as well as a defamation case brought against him by two election workers in the state.\nGiuliani\u2019s financial struggles became public knowledge when\nhe listed his co-op at 45 East 66th Street for $6.5 million\n, Business Insider\nreported\n. The listing popped up on the market towards the end of July and comes with a complicated history, especially in recent years.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman has the\nlisting\n.\nGiuliani purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002. The unit had enormous entertainment potential and it has entertained everything from podcast recordings to federal law enforcement agents when It was raided in 2021 by the FBI during its probe into Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine.\nA year after the purchase, Giuliani married Judith Nelson on the lawn of Gracie Mansion.\nGiulian\u2019s lawyer, Adam Katz, acknowledged that Giuliani was facing financial difficulties, and at one point in August, Giuliani owed nearly $3 million in legal fees.\nAdditionally, he is being sued by Robert J. Costello, a former associate, for unpaid legal fees, and he recently faced a lawsuit from Hunter Biden for his role in disseminating personal information about Mr. Biden.\nGiuliani has reportedly sought financial assistance from Donald Trump, believing he is owed millions of dollars for his efforts to support Trump\u2019s election campaign. In response to these requests, Trump hosted a high-priced fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey club to aid Giuliani and provide him with a financial lifeline.\n\u2014\nTed Glanzer",

        "content": "Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady will move his family office\u2019s HQ to Bay Harbor Islands.\nTEB Capital Management signed an\n8,400-square-foot lease\nat The Well, David Martin\u2019s wellness-oriented office, retail and condo project under construction at 1177 Kane Concourse. It represents about a quarter of a floor at the project.\nThe deal isn\u2019t the biggest, but it is indicative of a trend we\u2019ve been seeing, especially in South Florida. Wealthy executives and ultra-high net worth individuals relocating to Florida are buying or building waterfront estates, and they want an office nearby. As one office broker tells me, the boss who\u2019s paying the pricey office rent isn\u2019t going to want to spend hours in traffic. (We agreed that neither do the employees.)\nBrady\u2019s building a two-story estate in the exclusive Indian Creek Village, a 10-minute drive from The Well, which is expected to be completed next year.\nColliers\u2019 Kevin Gonzalez, who represented Brady\u2019s company with his colleague Stephen Rutchik, and Brandon Charnas of Current Real Estate Advisors, said the lease highlights the shift to \u201chospitality-driven\u201d office space. The Well will include health-focused offerings such as acupuncture and vitamin B12 drips.\nTere Blanca represented Martin\u2019s Terra in the deal.\n(One side note:\nCharnas\nis likely connected to Brady by way of Charnas\u2019 friend, Brett Mufson of Fontainebleau Development. Brady\u2019s pal and next-door neighbor on Indian Creek is Fontainebleau Development owner Jeffrey Soffer.)\nDemand is still strong for boutique high-end office projects, though leasing activity has slowed. The Well is about 35 percent preleased. Terra plans another Well-branded development in Coconut Grove, a luxury enclave that\u2019s also attracted its fair share of CEOs who have bought homes and set up office space, including Related Group\u2019s Jorge P\u00e9rez.\nIn Bay Harbor Islands, Brady can take over the remaining space on the floor if he finds a partner, Gonzalez said. Brady\u2019s business ventures include the sportswear company Brady Brands and the wellness-focused brand TB12.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAs of Aug. 17, buyer\u2019s broker commissions will not be listed on the Multiple Listing Service. How is your brokerage preparing? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\n\nResidential:\nVivian Dimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove Capital acquired the oceanfront estate at\n1460 South Ocean Boulevard\nin Manalapan that was once asking as much as $87.5 million. Edward London\u2019s London Financial South Ocean LLC sold the 1.5-acre property for an undisclosed price.\nCommercial:\nThe Algers, a longtime farming family in Miami-Dade, sold nearly 800 acres outside the county\u2019s Urban Development Boundary\nfor $56 million\n. The 22 parcels span from north of the Homestead-Miami Speedway to just south of the Homestead Air Reserve Base to a hidden buyer using a Delaware entity.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA waterfront mansion on the Jupiter Inlet Colony in Palm Beach County hit the market for nearly $40 million. The 8,179-square-foot, two-story home at 103 Lighthouse Drive is listed with Vince Marotta and Tony Hernandez of Illustrated Properties. It includes five bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. The 0.7-acre property has a beach, summer kitchen, pool, seawall, dock and boat lift. The home was completed in 2023.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nOlympic bronze medalists Stephen Nedoroscik, a.k.a. Pommel Horse Guy, and Brody Malone spent nearly two years training for the Paris Olympics at a gym in Sarasota, according to the\nTampa Bay Times\n. The gym where they\u2019ve been training features a full recovery center with a sauna, infrared panels and an ice plunge.\nElsewhere in Florida\nInvest 97L, a tropical depression (as of Friday, when I wrote this), will likely bring heavy downpours this weekend and into early next week, according to South Florida meteorologist\nJohn Morales\n.\nAn off-duty yacht captain told officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission that no other boats were involved when George Pino smashed his boat into a concrete marker in 2022, which neither the FWC nor Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office followed up on, the\nMiami Herald reports\n. Pino, who heads Doral-based commercial real estate brokerage State Street Realty, was driving his boat when he crashed, killing a teenage girl on board and severely disabling another.\nAttorney Pedro Echarte secured a $7 million settlement for his client, the estate of the late Luis Calles Cruz, a tenant who was killed during an attempted armed robbery and carjacking in 2021 at an apartment complex in Naranja in south Miami-Dade. The estate sued over an alleged lack of adequate security, the\nDaily Business Review\nreports. The defendants are companies managed by developer\nLewis Swezy\n.",

The price was not disclosed.\nJames Harris and David Parnes of Carolwood Estates\u2019 Bond Street Partners team represented Puth in the deal.\nThe \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk Anymore\u201d singer originally paid $9 million for the 4,439-square-foot property in 2017.\nPuth originally placed the four-bed, four-bath home at 1875 Carla Ridge on the market in November 2023 with a nearly $17 million ask.

It comes with history, having served as a gathering place for advisers to President Ronald Reagan and socialite Janet de Cordova and her husband and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\u201d producer Fred de Cordova.\nCarla Ridge, if closed, would add another notch in Flagg\u2019s expanding real estate portfolio.\nHe currently resides on Strada Corta Road in Bel-Air\u2019s lower East Gate, often referred to as Old Bel-Air.\nFlagg also bought 605 North Alta Drive in Beverly Hills in 2018 for just under $6 million, according to property records. He sold the property in 2022 for $8.1 million.\nIn addition, Flagg purchased 710 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, paying $8.4 million for it in 2022.\nBeyond Los Angeles, Flagg spent $4.3 million, with business partners Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld, for 4727 North Bay Road in Miami. He\u2019s also said to be eyeing multiple properties in New York with his father Michael Flagg.\n",

Sturgis and designed by architect William Otis, the mansion boasts a curved red brick perimeter wall and wrought iron gates.\nInside the 11,250-square-foot home, there are six bedrooms, six bathrooms, and five fireplaces. The kitchen features white marble countertops, top-of-the-line appliances, and a Farrow &amp; Ball blue island.\nThe second floor houses the primary bedroom suite with a fireplace, two walk-in closets, and three additional bedrooms. The third floor includes two more bedrooms, an office, and a game room. The basement, refinished by the Woods, has an arts and crafts studio, a gym with a sauna, a wine room, and a recreation room with a bar.\nOn the 0.71-acre property, the Woods added a swimming pool and a new pool house with amenities. Outdoor features also include an outdoor kitchen, pergola, fire pit, organic gardens, and a heated three-car garage with extra storage and a workbench.\nThe Woods are reportedly selling because they are \u201cchanging up things a bit,\u201d with their son graduating from high school, Radnay said.\nThe Woods have a history of real estate transactions in Winnetka and beyond. Notably, they\npreviously owned a newly built mansion in Winnetka\n, a Tudor Revival-style mansion, a Beaux-Arts-style mansion in Lincoln Park, a vintage house in the Old Town Triangle, a River North condo, and a waterfront mansion in Fontana, Wisconsin.\n\u2014 Ted Glanzer",

He died at the property in 1947.\nThe property featured a four-bedroom, 6,100-square-foot main house, a pool and two-story cabana, and the original gatehouse Capone installed that has been\nconverted\nto a two-bedroom guest house.\nTwo real estate developers, Todd Glaser and Nelson Gonzalez, bought the mansion for $10.75 million in 2021 and argued it had structural issues and was not worth saving due to Capone\u2019s violent history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something to celebrate, in my eyes,\u201d\nGlaser said in 2021 to the New York Times\n. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy the exposure that this house is getting because of who owned it. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\nThey plan to build a modern two-story home with amenities such as a Jacuzzi, sauna, and spa.\nPreservationists fought the plan, saying there was historical and cultural significance in the house.\nDaniel Ciraldo, the executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, argued that the house is part of the city\u2019s history, both positive and negative.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a saint by any means,\u201d Ciraldo told the Times. \u201cBut, at the same time, we think his home is a part of the history of our city: the good, the bad and the ugly. And we don\u2019t think it should be torn down and replaced with a McMansion.\u201d\nThe developers, however, won out, with Miami Beach issuing a demolition permit on July 20, which was set to expire in January.",

The buyer was an anonymous LLC from West Palm Beach, Florida.\nThe listing brokers for the condominium unit were Chris Pomeroy and Richard Orenstein of Brown Harris Stevens.\nLopez paid $20.1 million for the apartment, one of\nfour units\nin the six-story, neo-Georgian building, in 2014. She\nlisted it\nthree years later for $27 million but found no takers at that price.

Earlier this month, Lopez and Affleck listed their 38,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles for\n$68 million\n. The couple bought the 12-bedroom estate at 2571 Wallingford Drive in Beverly Crest in a $61 million cash deal last May.\u00a0Lopez also sold her mansion in Bel-Air last October for\n$34 million\n\u2014 $8.5 million less than the asking price.

Rimas specializes in Latin trap and reggaeton music. Its artists include Arc\u00e1ngel, Corina Smith and Amennazy, but its breakout star by far is Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny was Spotify\u2019s most-streamed artist for three years running, from 2020 to 2022, until he was bumped to second place by Taylor Swift last year. In 2022, Bad Bunny set the world record for highest grossing tour in a calendar year, bringing in $435.4 million with his World\u2019s Greatest Tour,\nHypebeast\nreported. Swift dethroned him once again with her billion-dollar Eras Tour.\nBad Bunny credits his rapid ascendence to Assad, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no big Bad Bunny superstar without Noah,\u201d when presenting Assad with Billboard\u2019s Executive of the Year award in 2023.\n\nThe Garnetts were an early Silicon Valley power couple. Katrina Garnett founded the software company CrossWorlds in 1996, in part with funding from her husband\u2019s venture capital firm at the time, Venrock Associates. After scandalizing Silicon Valley with a magazine ad in a black cocktail dress in 1998, Katrina Garnett sold CrossWorlds to IBM in 2001 for $129 million, according to published reports. Today, Terry Garnett heads HeyScottie.com and Inxeption.com, and Katrina Garnett leads Garnett Ventures and sits on the board of councilors for USC\u2019s Viterbi School of Engineering, LinkedIn shows.\nThe couple bought the\nOne Thousand Museum\nunit for $5.5 million in 2019, records show. Completed that year, it spans 4,600 square feet, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to property records. They listed it for $8 million in April, Redfin shows. Gonzalez said they had it rented to a tenant paying $45,000 a month in rent while it was on the market.\nThe late Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid designed the 62-story, 84-unit One Thousand Museum. A group consisting of Louis Birdman, Gilberto Bomeny, Kevin Venger, Gregg Covin and Todd Michael Glaser developed it, and the tower\u2019s amenities include a pool, gym, theater and spa facilities.\nThe tower has attracted celebrity owners like Victoria and David Beckham,\nMarc Anthony\nand David Grutman. In 2022, tech mogul Moisey Uretsky\ndropped $18.3 million\non a penthouse in the building, but Gonzalez said the tower had gone through a yearlong sales dry spell before reggaeton artist Nicky Jam sold his unit for\n$7 million\nlast month. Gonzalez said a few other units in the tower are likely going into contract soon.\n\u201c[Interest is] coming from people who were probably looking at these new construction [developments] and didn\u2019t want to wait,\u201d Gonzalez said of the new deals expected. He noted that Assad had also looked at new construction, but was familiar with One Thousand Museum through a friend. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want to wait.\u201d",

The Protecting Elderly Realty for Retirement Years Act, or PERRY Act, would require a 72-hour \u201ccool down\u201d period for real estate transactions where one of the participating parties is over the age of 75, according to the outlet.\nIt has received support from lawmakers across the country, according to its website.\nThe measure is being supported by the family of Carl Westcott, the 84-year-old founder of 1-800-FLOWERS. Westcott, Perry and her manager Bernie Gudvi have been embroiled in a three-year legal battle, slinging civil suits at one another over Perry\u2019s 2020 bid to buy Westcott\u2019s estate in Montecito, California, for $15 million.\nIt was reported at the time that Perry and Bloom closed on the 9-acre property for\n$14.2 million\n. Montecito, the coastal town famously home to Oprah, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, is a hub for luxury real estate.\n\nLawyers for Westcott, who suffers from Huntington\u2019s disease, claims he was of \u201cunsound mind\u201d when he agreed to the deal with Perry. Gudvi approached Westcott with an offer just three days after the elderly flower mogul went under a six-hour back surgery. When he tried to back out of the deal after getting off the drugs, Perry and Gudvi refused to let him out of the contract.\nHis lawyers say the deal is \u201cvoidable\u201d because he was\nhigh on painkillers\nwhen he signed a contract to sell the house he had bought just two months earlier.\nThe case between Perry and Westcott\u2019s family went to trial in August. Gudvi is now also countersuing Westcott to the tune of $5.9 million, the outlet reported.\nThis is not the first time Perry has found herself in a legal battle with the elderly and infirm. The singer took the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to court after they refused to sell her their eight-acre Los Feliz convent. She ultimately closed on the property for\n$14.5 million\n, but not before she spent $2.6 million in legal fees and\none of the nuns collapsed and died\nin court.\n\u2013\u2013\u00a0Kate Hinsche",

        "content": "Mauricio Umansky sat for a 45-plus-minute interview with\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nStuart Elliott on Oct. 23 at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nSalon Series event. Here are some highlights of what he had to say.\nKeys to life\nThe ability to read a room and the ability to sell are two of the most important things in life. \u2026 Understanding the mind allows you to start reading people allows you to start reading the room and allows you to start understanding that. But in order to do that \u2026 it\u2019s about being present, OK?\nSelling Lady Gaga a house\nI never asked her [about] her budget. I never asked her what area. I just said, what are you looking for. And she said, \u201cWell, I want space. I want paparazzi proof. I want to be able to have animals, chickens, dogs. \u2026 You have to have a complete knowledge of your market because you never know when you\u2019re going to be in a situation in a locker room [with Lady Gaga]. Backstage when somebody says what they want, and if you don\u2019t have that in your head, you\u2019re not selling the house.\nLife on reality TV\nReality TV is tough, man. At the end of the day, the reality is that you just have to let things brush off and not take anything too seriously. You just have to accept things. There\u2019s tabloids, there are stories, there is lies, there\u2019s more lies, and more lies. \u2026 At the end of the day, you just have to let everything brush off.\nOn reporting\nI can handle anything, as long as it\u2019s backed by truth. I do not like it when there is stories that are not fact checked and they\u2019re just written and they\u2019re just thrown out there, like gossip.\nOn fame\nI don\u2019t view fame as a thing. I hate fame. I forget about it all the time. I\u2019m walking down the street, I\u2019m walking down the street, I get stopped and, like, \u201cOh, Mauricio,\u201d and I\u2019m like, yeah, I get scared. I\u2019m like, what did I do wrong? Did I cross the street wrong? \u2026 I just care about living the day, enjoying the day. You know, one of the most important things for me is living every second to the fullest potential.\nState of the business\n\n1995 was the last time we saw business this bad. Mortgage applications are down below levels of 1995. \u2026 Business sucks, OK? You got to balance your P&amp;Ls to whatever the business is out there. \u2026 So the idea is as a brokerage firm, you got to look at success based on what kind of market share you\u2019re capturing. Are you winning the market share game? \u2026 This is the opportunity to differentiate yourself.\nNAR lawsuit decoupling buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s agents commissions\nI think it sucks. I think it\u2019s a major issue in the country. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. \u2026 I think we should all leave NAR and create our own coalition. I just said it.\nOn Compass\nThere\u2019s many ways to get somewhere and Compass today is the largest brokerage in the country, and that\u2019s amazing. \u2026 My whole thing on whatever you do is just telling the truth. Particularly if you\u2019re a public company. But I think that what they have done is amazing. What we have done is amazing. We\u2019ve grown in two completely different ways. .. I don\u2019t like to look at what our competitors are doing. If anybody knows me, you know that I will never talk bad about a competitor. I don\u2019t consider them competitors. I consider them colleagues.\nThe Agency\u2019s growth\nWe\u2019re about to open our 100th office, I think we\u2019re going to do $14 billion worth of real estate sales this year, plus or minus, on a million-dollar investment with zero debt.\nPossibility of going public\nIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about giving back to everybody that has worked with us. \u2026 Right now is the wrong time to do it. I have put that on the shelf for a while. It\u2019s definitely not in the cards right now. I\u2019m not even thinking about it right now. But when the market changes, I\u2019ll be thinking about it.\nLA mansion tax\nIt\u2019s a real mess. They really screwed this thing up and I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this thing at all. It\u2019s an absolute mess. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing with the money.\nPro-business cities\nNew York is a very pro [business] \u2026 look, you guys have some pretty fucked up politics here as well. .. But did you know that people like to do business in New York. \u2026 Dallas is a pro business city right now. You want to see a pro business city right now, it\u2019s Dallas. That is 100 percent a pro business city.",

The Journal did not include the unit number, but the outlet\u2019s description matches a listing for PH5.\nSales at the building launched in March, with Compass\u2019 new development marketing arm, led by\ntop broker Alexa Lambert\n, Susan Wires and Marc Achilles, at the helm.\nAbout half of its 36 units have found buyers. Construction at the 18-story condominium is expected to be completed next year. Its planned amenities include an outdoor fireplace, movie theater and virtual sports room.\n\u201cWe decided to lean into New York City at a time when many others were leaning out,\u201d EJS\u2019 founder Ted Segal told the Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to see how the market\u2019s responding to the vision we had for the project.\u201d\nSegal declined to comment on the specifics of the deal.\nEJS assembled the land for its development in 2021 for a combined $32 million. The building and its neighbor, a 33-story project by the Elad Group, are\nenveloping a century-old walkup\n, as the four-story apartment building holds on to its Third Avenue spot through a network of tenant protections and zoning rules.\n\nThe developer was funding the early stages of construction out of pocket until it scored roughly $112 million in financing from Bank OZK last year.\nLindor joined the Mets in 2021, after more than five years with the Cleveland Guardians, previously known as the Indians. He signed a 10-year contract worth $341 million, which at the time made him the\nhighest-paid player\nin the team\u2019s history.\nThe 31-year-old baseball star was eclipsed by a fellow New York star on Sunday when the franchise agreed to what ESPN billed as the \u201c\nlargest deal\nin professional sports history. \u201c\nThe Mets, owned by billionaire Steve Cohen, signed outfielder Juan Soto to a 15-year, $765 million contract. The star, who\u2019s joining from the New York Yankees off a World Series run, was reportedly offered a\n$760 million contract\nto stay with the Bronx Bombers.\n\nLindor, who was born in Puerto Rico, also has a home outside of Orlando, Florida, which he purchased for $2.9 million in 2021.\nLindor could not be reached by the publication for comment. He was represented in the deal by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Dan Benichou.\n\u2014 Sheridan Wall",

        "content": "Floyd Mayweather Jr. has shelled out hundreds of millions\nin his quest\nto become one of New York\u2019s top real estate dealmakers. Now he\u2019s got the apartment to match.\nAfter weeks of house hunting, the 15-time boxing world champion rented an apartment at the Baccarat Hotel and Residences for $100,000 a month, the\nNew York Post\nfirst reported. The unit, dubbed the \u201cGemstone Terrace,\u201d spans the 18th and 19th floors of Tribeca Associates\u2019 Midtown building.\nMayweather\u2019s latest real estate move comes two months after he embarked on\na spending spree\n, investing in apartment and office portfolios across New York, Chicago and Miami. One of his deals included a $100 million stake in a joint venture with Go Partners, which he used to soft launch his new real estate company, Vada Properties.\nConsidered the world\u2019s wealthiest boxer, with career earnings of more than a billion dollars, has been on the lookout for new digs since at least late November when the Post\nchronicled his search\nacross Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. He reportedly viewed a penthouse in Soho asking $150,000 a month, which was once the home of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and a $50 million Gilded Age mansion on 54th Street.\nSerhant\u2019s Talia McKinney, who the Post identified as the broker at showings with Mayweather and his entourage, declined to comment.\nMayweather\u2019s new apartment at 20 West 53rd Street spans 4,200 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features an eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen and 3,100 square feet of outdoor space. Amenities in the building include access to the Baccarat Hotel\u2019s services, including a fitness center, pool and concierge.\n\nListing agents Ryan Garson and Brian Lewis of Compass declined to comment.\nMayweather launched his investment streak in mid-October when he bought an Upper Manhattan apartment portfolio from Black Spruce Management\u2019s Josh Gotlib for\n$402 million\n. The portfolio included 1,000 affordable housing units across 60 buildings and ranks as one of the largest deals in the city this year.\nHe spent about $100 million investing in nine of SL Green\u2019s skyscrapers in the city and coughed up more for a stake in 601W Companies\u2019\n$10 billion office portfolio\n, which includes buildings such as 410 10th Avenue in Hudson Yards, the Old Post Office Building in Chicago and the Harborside office complex in Jersey City. He also invested in the former Versace Mansion, which is now a luxury hotel in Miami Beach.\nHe spent another $100 million on a $3 billion luxury and market-rate rental portfolio with Go Partners, a joint venture between Meyer Orbach of Orbach Affordable Housing Solutions and Black Spruce\u2019s Gotlib.\nLast month, he sold his waterfront mansion in Miami Beach for\n$22 million\n. He listed his home in Las Vegas for $12.5 million.\n",

The hotel chain has dozens of locations nationwide.\nIn July it was announced that a\nMargaritaville-branded hotel could anchor\na proposed waterfront mixed-use project in Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village.\nThe project\u2019s master developer, Atlanta-based APD Solutions, is partnering with singer-turned-hotelier\nJimmy Buffett\nto add a five-story building with 150 rooms and an 875-space parking garage to anchor the proposed mixed-use site, which also entails 225,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space.\nVaughn Irons, APD\u2019s CEO, unveiled his development team\u2019s plan last month during a meeting of the Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency, which owns the sprawling 90-acre redevelopment site known as Marina Village.

        "content": "The frenzy surrounding Lionel Messi\u2019s arrival in South Florida \u2013 and who he\u2019s brought with him \u2013 is unreal.\nI have a Google Alert set for \u201clionel messi miami house.\u201d Some days, I get more than a dozen emails. One website posted about renderings showing a very futuristic and unrealistic mansion that an artist designed for Messi with seven swimming pools, a 20-car garage and three helipads.\nI reported last week that his longtime teammate, Sergio Busquets,\nbought a waterfront home\nin Broward County. Then, Google alerted me that the house Busquets purchased was near Messi\u2019s home, per a blog. (As far as I know, Messi doesn\u2019t own a house \u2014 yet.)\nBusquets paid about $8.7 million for a waterfront home in Sea Ranch Lakes, a very small coastal town in Broward where we speculated Messi could be living. (Messi was spotted at a Publix in Sea Ranch Lakes, fueling this speculation.)\nFor a while, many assumed that Messi was living at the unit he owns at Porsche Design Tower in Sunny Isles Beach. But according to an MLS listing, Messi has been renting the unit out since February for $28,500.\nOn top of eventually cashing out on the investment, some athletes buy condos because of the convenience, amenities and security they offer, says Lucas Boccheciampe of Vantage Luxury Real Estate.\n\u201cDavid Beckham is living at One Thousand Museum for the same reasons,\u201d Boccheciampe said, referring to the Inter Miami co-owner. \u201cIt\u2019s a super-secure building, with few neighbors, and great amenities.\u201d\nLast year, LeBron James bought a unit at the Estates at Acqualina in Sunny Isles Beach.\nBut Messi will prioritize privacy, as best he can. Boccheciampe said that when Messi rented a waterfront home in Key Biscayne, superfans in kayaks tried to get his attention from the water. Police had to close off the street.\nDeveloper Kevin Venger said that more than anything, buyers like Messi want to be able to enter and leave their homes without being seen. Venger was part of the team that developed Regalia in Sunny Isles, where Messi\u2019s family owns a unit, and One Thousand Museum, where Beckham owns.\n\u201cThey want to protect their families and be able to enjoy their life without it being splattered around magazines,\u201d he said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat will happen to ex-HFZ developer Nir Meir and Ranee Bartolacci? ICYMI, Bartolacci unveiled some\nwild allegations\nin her divorce filings. Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nGerman music producer Frank Farian sold the waterfront vacant lot at 3100 North Bay Road to a Delaware LLC named for the address. The Miami Beach property sold for\n$13.6 million\n, with plans for an 11,600-square-foot mansion.\nCommercial:\nSteve Ross\u2019 Related Cos.\npaid $194.6 million\nfor the South Flagler House condo development site at 1355 South Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach. Frisbie Group and Hines sold the 3.4-acre property, where they had planned to build the two-tower, 28-story development.\n\u2014 Research by Adam Farence\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nVenture capitalist Christopher Burch (ex-husband of Tory Burch) listed his waterfront mansion at 5050 North Bay Road for\n$49 million\n. His Miami Beach estate includes a 7,000-square-foot main house, a 1,500-square-foot guest home and 140 feet of frontage on Biscayne Bay. Mirce Curkoski and Albert Justo of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nIndia\nsuccessfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft\non the south pole of the moon, making it the first country to explore that region of the lunar surface. It is only the fourth country in history to land spacecraft on the moon, behind Russia, the U.S. and China, per the Washington Post.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA Zillow listing falsely reported that Donald Trump sold his historic Mar-a-Lago Club for $422 million,\nNewsweek\nreports. The listing, which has since been corrected, showed Trump sold the resort on Aug. 4, fueling rumors of the former president\u2019s trouble with legal fees. \"Mar-a-Lago has absolutely not been sold nor will it ever be. This rumor is asinine,\" Eric Trump told the outlet.\nFlorida CFO Jimmy Patronis said he would investigate Farmers Insurance after the company said it would not renew 100,000 policies, the\nOrlando Sentinel\nreports. More than a dozen insurers have left the Florida market, and rates continue to rise.\nTrans rights took another hit in Florida. The state\u2019s education board approved a new rule stating trans college staffers can be fired for using bathrooms that align with their gender identities, according to\nNBC\n.\nSpecial thanks to my colleague Kate Hinsche, who contributed to this newsletter.",

The property received extensive renovations in 2016 and now looks nothing like its former self, when it was owned by the two celebrities.\nAnother $2.7 million was pumped into the home by the current seller, who Parnes declined to provide details on, with updates spanning the outdoor motor gate and front entrance steps, to bedroom built-ins and a new guest bedroom with a marble fireplace.\nProperty records show the home is owned by a Rhode Island-based trust.\nTotaling 9,400 square feet, the three-floor home has five bedrooms and nine baths. It\u2019s on a roughly 1.2-acre lot with a theater, separate wing for a fitness studio and massage room, elevator, floor-to-ceiling windows, wraparound terrace and two wet bars.\nThe property last traded in December 2020 for $12.2 million, according to listing sites.\nSales in the Bird Streets have moved in line with L.A.\u2019s overall luxury home market. Interest rates, among other factors, hampered deals earlier in the year. Now, with more rate cuts expected, agents see some business coming back.\n\u201cSentiment feels good right now and there\u2019s momentum,\u201d Parnes said on a recent weekday, while standing on the home\u2019s balcony overlooking the city.\n\nIt could help that the Rising Glen home\u2019s next-door neighbor may have reset the market.\nThe 23,000-square-foot mansion at\n1898 Rising Glen Road\nsold in April for $62.8 million, marking L.A. County\u2019s priciest on-market deal this year.\nAn LLC called Starlight Capital bought the eight-bed, 18-bath home from spec developers Brandon and Deborah Shainfeld.\nThe buyers were represented by Haylen\u2019s Chong and Leung, while Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Andreas Elsenhans represented the sellers.\nOther sellers in the vicinity have also sought to test buyer appetite for the neighborhood in recent months.\nWithin the Bird Streets, there\u2019s 1380 Mockingbird Place, which was relisted earlier this month for just under $35 million. There\u2019s also 1457 Blue Jay Way, which was relisted for nearly $20 million in May, after last being listed in September 2023.\nElsewhere in the Hollywood Hills, the home at 8116 Laurel View Drive, which sits above the famed Chateau Marmont, sold for $19 million last December and was placed on the market in September for nearly $24 million.\nSpears bought the home in 2001 at the age of 19, paying a little less than $3 million. The \u201cToxic\u201d singer sold the house to Murphy in 2003.\n",

But the foreclosure process appeared to be moving ahead prior to this most recent bankruptcy filing.\n\nDeutsche Bank is the sole creditor listed with a claim of $3.3 million, according to the bankruptcy filing.\nLawyers for Kavovit and Deutsche Bank did not respond to requests for comment.\nOutside of her reality TV stint on the Bravo franchise, Kavovit helms a construction company. She made headlines in 2021 when she announced her intention to run for mayor of New York City. (Kavovit, who didn\u2019t qualify for the ballot, later dropped out of the race.)\nKavovit told the\nNew York Times\nin a 2021 interview that she lived on the Upper East Side in a \u201cnon-fancy apartment building.\u201d In her bankruptcy filing, Kavovit\u2019s place of business is listed as a two-bedroom, two-bathroom Upper East Side unit that last rented for $4,900 in 2013, according to StreetEasy.\nKavovit also purchased a $2.1 million apartment in the East Village on Avenue A, according to public records. The condo was listed for $2 million in 2024 before it was delisted and transferred to a limited liability company with Kavovit\u2019s same address.\n",

It sits on a half-acre lot and has a library, wine cellar and guest house with a theater and gym, according to the listing. It\u2019s about a five-minute walk to the Beverly Hills Hotel.\nJosh Altman and Matt Altman of Douglas Elliman\u2019s The Altman Brothers Team have the listing.\nThe boxing champ paid $25.5 million for the property in 2017, just a few weeks after taking home the $100 million purse from his win over Conor McGregor.\n\nMayweather bought the home from developer Nile Niami, whose most ambitious project was the over 100,000-square-foot megamansion named \u201cThe One.\u201d The property, at one time valued at $500 million, was bought at auction in 2022 for $141 million by Fashion Nova founder Richard Saghian.\nAlthough Mayweather retired in 2017 from boxing with an undefeated record, he more recently has reentered the ring for exhibition fights. In August he faced off with John Gotti III in a Mexico City exhibition rematch.\nMayweather signaled on social media he\u2019s game for more.\n\u201cSuccess isn\u2019t something you retire from. It\u2019s something you refine,\u201d he told his followers on Instagram earlier this month. \u201cExhibitions are my way of giving my fans, old and new, the opportunity to witness my greatness on any stage I choose. That\u2019s what any successful business and boss would do.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Earlier this summer, a photo of Lionel Messi shopping at a South Florida Publix practically broke the internet.\nLa Pulga\u2019s errand revealed both his family\u2019s penchant for Lucky Charms and his whereabouts \u2013\u2013 the soccer star was in Sea Ranch Lakes, fueling rumors that he was living in the tiny village. Then, Messi\u2019s longtime teammate and friend, Sergio Busquets, bought a waterfront home there last month for a\nrecord $8.7 million\n.\nWhile Messi has yet to purchase a house while he plays for Inter Miami (he may be buying\nthis $29.7 million Fort Lauderdale manse\n), he and Busquets brought the spotlight to\nSea Ranch Lakes\n, an understated gated community in Broward County.\n\u201cWe were the best kept secret for a long, long time,\u201d said Coldwell Banker agent Veroushka Maclean Volkert.\nIt raises the question: What\u2019s so great about Sea Ranch Lakes?\n\u201cSea Ranch was really under the radar for a long time. Now it\u2019s popped up on top of [buyers\u2019] lists,\u201d said Chad Carroll, an agent with Compass.\nReal estate watchers and f\u00fatbol fans alike knew the new top players would be looking for homes in Broward, near Inter Miami\u2019s Drive Pink Stadium and training facilities in Fort Lauderdale. Luxury communities in\nFort Lauderdale, as well as in Palm Beach County\u2019s Delray Beach and Boca Raton\ncould all be on the table. Security and privacy would be of the utmost importance.\nThat\u2019s something Sea Ranch Lakes can provide, agents said. Spanning a mere 122 acres, or 0.2 square miles, the majority of the village is fully walled, with its own police force and a guardhouse at the entrance, manned by an officer at all hours of the day. Similar communities have to hire private security teams, which don\u2019t have the same powers that a police department does, agents added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the safest community in the tri-county [area],\u201d said Zorka Dobreva, an agent with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\nThe village has a little more than 200 homes and a private oceanfront beach club. It has its own mayor,\nreal estate attorney Jeffrey Nelson\n. Houses in the village are either on dry lots, lakefront lots or lots along the Intracoastal Waterway. Current listings for single-family homes range in price from $3 million to $13 million for a waterfront spec house, Redfin shows.\nWhile the enclave\u2019s small size and dedicated police force appeal to the safety-oriented buyer, agents say Sea Ranch Lakes residents are accustomed to A-lister neighbors and aren\u2019t the type to pry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very chill. We\u2019ve had NFL players, NBA players, race car drivers, executives,\u201d Volkert said. \u201cPeople are respectful, and it\u2019s private, and they respect their privacy.\u201d\nSea Ranch Lakes is also close to some of the top private schools in South Florida, an added appeal for parents who don\u2019t want long commutes, agents said.\nDecades ago, Sea Ranch Lakes was farmland owned by Robert Hayes Gore, the former governor of Puerto Rico and publishing magnate who owned the Sun Sentinel and Fort Lauderdale News until he sold them for $18 million in 1963, according to published reports. The Gore family established the Village of Sea Ranch Lakes in 1959, naming it after the nearby Sea Ranch Hotel, according to published reports.\n\nAgents say it\u2019s a quintessentially \u201cold Florida\u201d kind of community, with traditions that have stood the test of time. The annual Fourth of July parade, Halloween party, and Easter egg hunt are kids\u2019 favorites. The adults-only Christmas party is a major event. Residents ride around in golf carts, wearing shorts and flip flops most days, agents said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a pretentious neighborhood. It\u2019s really low key,\u201d Carroll said.\nYet, he doesn\u2019t see the village\u2019s real estate market staying that way, thanks in part to Messi and Busquets.\n\u201cI see the prices in Sea Ranch going through the roof, especially for the prime waterfront Intracoastal homes,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the price increases are going to be dramatic.\u201d",

The sale, which amounted to just over $1,500 per square foot, was handled by his father, Compass\u2019 Richard Steinberg.\nThe 7,600-square-foot home originally hit the market in Feb. 2023 asking $18.5 million, almost double the $9.7 million the younger Steinberg and his wife, Jill, paid for it in 2019.\n\u201cWe knew we came on very strong previously,\u201d said the elder Steinberg. He took the home off the market for over a year before relisting last September at a lower price with the goal of a \u201cquick sale\u201d to aid his son\u2019s move back stateside from London.\nJon founded streaming company Cheddar, which sold to Altice USA for $200 million in cash in 2019. Before that, he served as the chief executive officer of the Daily Mail\u2019s North American arm and the chief operating officer of BuzzFeed from 2012 to 2014.\nHe was tapped in 2023 to run Future plc, the British publishing giant that owns publications like Marie Claire and PC Gamer. In October, Jon announced his plans to step down to \u201crelocate back to the U.S. with his family,\u201d according to a release.\nThe senior Steinberg said his son was easy to work with and not particularly hands-on in the sale process. \u201cHe said, \u2018Dad do what you have to do to get it sold,\u2019\u201d the broker said.\nBuilt in 1881, the 18-foot-wide home has five bedrooms and five bathrooms across five stories. The property also features a roof deck with an outdoor kitchen.\n\nThe sellers executed a multimillion-dollar gut renovation, which Richard said has been an even greater boon for townhouses in today\u2019s market.\n\u201cTriple mint townhouses sell quickly,\u201d he said, referring\nto a term\nfor properties considered to have pristine kitchens, bathrooms and overall condition. \u201cBased on market conditions and construction costs and tariffs people are inclined to not move quickly on stuff that needs gut renovations.\u201d\nCompass\u2019 Philip Scheinfeld and Alexa Horgan brought the buyer, who Scheinfeld said was \u201csuper happy\u201d to find something for around $1,500 per square foot located west of Park Avenue.\nUpper East Side townhouses between 17 and 19 feet wide had an average price per square foot of $1,737, according to Leslie Garfield\u2019s townhouse market\nreport\n.\nScheinfeld said he and Horgan had been working with the buyers for several years, looking across the city with a budget that started around $8 million.\n\u201cWe found we got better value as the price point went up,\u201d he said.\nThe property is occupied by tenants paying around $50,000 in monthly rent who will move out in June, Scheinfeld said.\n",

The Cosbys owe a principal balance of $3.7 million, according to the lawsuit, while also racking up hundreds of thousands in interest and fees.\nThe lawsuit was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe Cosbys purchased the four-story, 5,000-square-foot townhouse in the 1980s for $327,000, according to PincusCo, using it as a second home. It\u2019s unclear if Bill ever lived in the home, as Cosby\u2019s late son, Ennis, was said to live at the property in a New York Times\neulogy\n.\nFeatures of the property, including the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in the home, were not available on prominent listing sites, such as Zillow, Redfin and Realtor.com.\n\nCosby owns another home in Lenox Hill, 10 blocks north of the one in danger of being foreclosed upon. He purchased the 12,000-square-foot East 71st Street townhouse in 1987 for $6.2 million.\nCosby\u2019s real estate holdings also include an estate in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, which is where the actor fled to when his sexual assault conviction was overturned in 2021, Fox Business\nreported\n. He and his wife paid $225,000 for the property in 1983, moving in a year before\nThe Cosby Show\nlaunched him into further fame.\nThe man once known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d served three years of a 10-year prison sentence for sexual assault before the conviction was overturned. More than 50 women have accused the 87-year-old of sexual assault or misconduct, allegations Cosby has consistently denied.\nIn 2022, Cosby was found civilly liable for the sexual assault of a 16-year-old. He has not played a role other than himself in film or television since 2000.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

She reportedly\nbought the place\nin 2019 for $5.5 million before embarking on a remodel.\nThe home dates back to 1920, though it\u2019s been redesigned several times since then. There\u2019s seven bedrooms and six bathrooms between the main house and a small guest cottage.

        "content": "Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady scored a $35 million loan for his waterfront Indian Creek Village estate.\nCitizens Bank is providing the financing for the property at 26 Indian Creek Island Road, records show.\nThe loan likely pays off and replaces a\n$35 million construction loan\nthe retired NFL athlete secured in June 2023 from J.P. Morgan Bank, though a satisfaction of that mortgage has not yet been recorded. It has a maturity date of June 2025, and an initial 8.25 percent annual interest rate during the construction period.\nThe new loan has a lower interest rate that starts at 5.63 percent, with payments beginning in August 2035 and the first interest rate change in 2031. The loan matures in 2054, assuming\nBrady\ndoesn\u2019t refinance or sell the property before then. Wealth manager Brian Blanchard of SCS Financial signed the latest mortgage on behalf of the LLC that owns the property. Blanchard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBrady\u2019s two-story estate, in exclusive and private Indian Creek Village, calls for a separate gym, cabana, sport court, study, a waterfront pool and spa, outdoor kitchen, gardens and a tree-lined driveway leading up to a motor court with a multi-car garage, renderings previously obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshow. The home\u2019s primary and guest suites include their own terraces. It appears to still be under construction.\n\nBrady, who spent most of his NFL career with the New England Patriots, bought the 2-acre lot almost four years ago with his now ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen. They acquired the property through an LLC tied to Jeff Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Development. Soffer and Brady are good friends, and\nSoffer lives next door\nat 27 Indian Creek Island Road.\nB\u00fcndchen owns a waterfront home right across the waterway on Biscaya Drive in Surfside. The supermodel, cookbook author and environmental and health advocate also owns a non-waterfront home in Surfside and a 7.5-acre\nequestrian estate in Southwest Ranches\n, which is in western Broward county.\nIndian Creek, which has long been home to uber wealthy business people and celebrities, is now home to even wealthier residents. Over the past year, billionaire Amazon founder\nJeff Bezos\nspent $234 million to acquire\nthree waterfront estates\nin Indian Creek.\nDJ and producer\nDavid Guetta\nis also in contract to buy the waterfront spec estate at 37 Indian Creek Island Drive that is asking $69 million. And\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner\nlast year completed renovations to their waterfront mansion, next door to Guetta\u2019s future home.\n",

        "content": "Alleged fraudsters may have taken words from a famous Elvis Presley song too seriously: \u201cA little less conversation, a little more action.\u201d\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is looking into a botched attempt to sell the famed Graceland mansion in Memphis at a foreclosure auction, the Associated Press\nreported\n. The AG\u2019s decision comes after a chaotic week that almost saw the tourist attraction sold from beneath ownership\u2019s blue suede shoes.\nThe drama started when Naussany Investments and Private Lending tried to sell the home/museum in a foreclosure auction, claiming the late Lisa Marie Presley failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan originated in 2018 that used Graceland as collateral. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate was posted earlier in the month.\nThe auction was scheduled Thursday, but an injunction Wednesday halted the sale. That injunction came shortly after Elvis\u2019 granddaughter, actress Riley Keough, filed a lawsuit claiming fraud by Naussany and sought a restraining order.\n\nThe Presley estate alleged the claim to Graceland was based on forged documents presented in September; Keough became owner of the estate following her mother\u2019s death in January 2023. The notary on Naussany\u2019s documents never met or notarized anything for Lisa Marie, according to the lawsuit. Naussany denied the allegations and fought the injunction, in vain.\nOnce the injunction came down, Naussany appeared to back down. A supposed spokesperson for the company said it would drop its claim because paperwork would need to be filed in multiple states, without detailing why that would be the case.\nOther authorities in Tennessee don\u2019t appear to be looking into the Graceland drama at the moment. The FBI does not comment on the potential for investigations.\nGraceland has operated as a museum and tourist attraction since 1982, five years after Elvis\u2019 death. Hundreds of thousands of visitors can\u2019t help stopping by Graceland each year, or the Elvis-themed entertainment complex across the street.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Philipson, a controversial investor in elder care facilities, founded the nursing home consulting firm called Philosophy Care. He and his wife paid $9.3 million for the property in 2020, which at the time included a home.

It was on the market with Douglas Elliman agents Ruthie and Ethan Assouline of the Assouline Team for $28.5 million. The sale closed last week, according to the buyer\u2019s agent, Bento Queiroz of Compass. Queiroz declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity. The Assoulines also declined to comment.\n\nThe property, in a guard-gated community, comes with approved plans for a 13,000-square-foot mansion, according to the listing. Queiroz said his client was looking for a waterfront, oversized lot in a private neighborhood.\nRecent sales in Bal Harbour include David Arison\u2019s\n$23 million purchase\nof a waterfront home.\nIf he joins Inter Miami, Neymar will be playing with his former Barcelona teammates, Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Luis Su\u00e1rez. In March, Su\u00e1rez\npaid $11.5 million\nfor a\u00a0 waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s gated Bay Colony neighborhood, near Messi. Messi bought his Bay Colony home in September of last year for\n$10.8 million\n.\n\nEven Inter Miami\u2019s owners have been buying and selling homes as of late. David Beckham, a co-owner of the MLS franchise, and his wife Victoria Beckham recently\npaid $72 million\nfor a waterfront spec mansion on North Bay Road in Miami Beach.\nBeckham and his Inter Miami partners, led by MasTec Chairman Jorge Mas, plan to develop a major\nmixed-use soccer complex\non the former Melreese golf course site near Miami International Airport.

        "content": "A Brooklyn Heights duplex, previously rented by Ed Sheeran, is once again seeking a top-dollar price.\nThe fully-furnished apartment at Toll Brothers\u2019 Pierhouse hit the market last week asking $38,000 a month, according to a listing on Compass\u2019 website. Unit S405 last rented for that price in March, when a New York-based athlete signed the lease, a source familiar with the agreement told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIt\u2019s a hefty price tag for a Brooklyn abode, though it won\u2019t be the borough\u2019s priciest rental to hit the books so far this year.\nTRD\nreported last week that Brooklyn Nets guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der is shelling out\n$40,000 a month\nfor a sprawling townhouse in Red Hook, with the option to buy it.\nEd Sheeran leased the apartment at 130 Furman Street last year for $36,000 a month, making it the\npriciest rental\nin the borough in 2023. The rental deal with the 33-year-old British musician ended earlier this year, after the pad returned to the market in January. An unknown buyer paid $6 million for the duplex back in 2018.\nThe unit spans 3,200 square feet and has three bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a private rooftop with views of Manhattan across the East River,\nSarah Williams with Societe Real Estate, who also previously represented the rental listing, said the home was popular with tenants who were also looking for rental spots in Tribeca. Though the asking price is steep, she said a unit of similar size, views and outdoor space in the downtown Manhattan neighborhood would likely ask closer to $58,000 a month.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of a bargain for what it\u2019s offering,\u201d Williams said.\nAmong apartments available for rent in Tribeca is a four-bedroom penthouse at 39 Lispenard Street asking $50,000 a month, and a 3,000-square-foot unit at 56 Leonard Street asking $41,000 a month. The priciest is a 4,600-square-foot penthouse at 15 Leonard Street asking $80,000 a month.\nAcross the river, few homes are on the market asking for monthly rental prices for $20,000 or more. The priciest is a six-bedroom mansion near Prospect Park \u2014 with roughly double the square footage of the Dumbo condo \u2014 asking $35,000 a month. A two-bedroom condo at 185 Plymouth Street in Dumbo is asking $20,000.\nPierhouse \u2014 a two-building project by Toll Brothers City Living and Starwood Capital Group \u2014 has attracted other celebrities since sales launched in 2014. Last year, rapper Kendrick Lamar paid\n$8.6 million\nfor a duplex at the waterfront development.\nAmenities at the building near Brooklyn Bridge Park include access to services at the 1 Hotel, two fitness centers, 24-hour attended lobby and garage with valet parking.\n",

        "content": "2024 was a long year. \u201cWe have so much news, it\u2019s crazy\u201d is a phrase that my editor and I have found ourselves repeating to each other.\nSome things remained constant. High interest rates kept deal activity suppressed across resi and commercial real estate. Still, home buyers and sellers set records. Commercial properties traded \u2014 some at losses \u2014 and leases were signed. Condo owners and condo associations were forced to start paying attention to new legislation. An appeals court ruling in March put some condo buyout deals in limbo, and put one planned development (the Edition Residences in Miami\u2019s Edgewater) on hold.\nPalm Beach and its sister city across the bridge garnered more attention from developers, tenants and buyers. We reported on bad brokers. More to come on that in 2025.\nThe FBI was busy. Scandals continued to plague the Magic City.\nHere are\nsome\nof the highs and the lows of what we covered in 2024.\nFBI arrests the Alexander brothers\nOren and Tal Alexander were among the top real estate agents in Miami and New York, respectively, until last summer, when\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported\non civil lawsuits that alleged Oren and his twin Alon, and later Tal, drugged and raped women. In the months that followed, more women came forward with similar allegations. The Alexanders\u2019 business, the Side-backed brokerage Official, collapsed, and in December, the FBI\narrested\nthe three brothers in Miami Beach and Bal Harbour on federal sex trafficking charges. Oren and Alon also face state charges of sexual battery. The\nallegations\ndate back to when the brothers attended high school in North Miami Beach, and are as recent as 2021.\nHomebuilder Sergio Pino dies by suicide as FBI was about to arrest him\nIn 2024, the FBI and U.S. Attorney\u2019s office were also probing murder-for-hire attempts allegedly made by developer\nSergio Pino\n, a prominent South Florida homebuilder, against his estranged wife, Tatiana. Pino shot himself to death at his waterfront home in the ritzy Cocoplum neighborhood of Coral Gables in July as the FBI planned to arrest him for orchestrating multiple failed attempts to have Tatiana killed.\nCelebrity dealmaking\nResi sales volume fell, and owners, in some cases, slashed their asking prices. But celebrities still bet on South Florida.\nDavid and Victoria Beckham (have you heard of them?) paid just over\n$72 million\nfor a waterfront spec mansion in Miami Beach, setting a record for the city\u2019s North Bay Road, in October. Developer Niklas de la Motte sold the home, which was on the market with Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty for $80 million.\nHere are some other notable deals, though not all involve true celebrities:\n\nAll luxury eyes were on Palm Beach, home to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, and nearby towns. Fox News host Bret Baier sold his Palm Beach house, while former Fox alum Sean Hannity\npaid $24 million\nfor a mansion in Manalapan. Billy Joel sold his nearby estate for $43 million.\nNeymar bought a waterfront lot in Bal Harbour. Consumer goods multimillionaire Anand Khubani paid $100 million for an assemblage on La Gorce Island in Miami Beach. French Montana bought a home in Golden Beach. Floyd Mayweather Jr. sold his Miami Beach home, but purchased a stake in Casa Casuarina, previously known as the Versace Mansion.\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos\npaid $87 million\nfor his third waterfront estate in the Miami area, bringing his total spent in the exclusive Indian Creek Village to $234 million. (One of these deals sparked a lawsuit that was filed against\nDouglas Elliman\n, the brokerage involved in the deal. And in case you missed it\u2026 Elliman was also in the spotlight in 2024. The brokerage struggled with shaky financial performance, saw the sudden resignation of Howard Lorber and was brought into the Alexanders story.)\nOffice market flounders\nSouth Florida\u2019s office market, touted as immune to the woes facing other major metros, showed signs of cracking for the first time since the pandemic boom. Investment sales fell\nsignificantly\ncompared to before the pandemic. New-to-market firms pulled back, and some companies that leased during the boom backed out of their deals. And some landlords had to face their mounting debt woes.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat expectations, good or bad, do you have for South Florida real estate in 2025? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nOur research team compiled the top sales and leases of the year. Check them out\nhere\n.\nResidential\n: Todd Michael Glaser and his partners sold the 2.3-acre private Palm Beach island called Tarpon Island for\n$150 million in May\n. Australian infrastructure investor Michael Dorrell acquired the nearly 24,000-square-foot mansion, which hit the market in 2022 for $218 million.\nCommercial\n: In October, Reuben Brothers purchased the W Hotel South Beach at 2201 Collins Avenue for\nmore than $400 million\nfrom New York developers Aby Rosen and David Edelstein. The deal included 175 hotel rooms and 173 condo-hotel units.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe new mansion at 999 Hillsboro Mile in Hillsboro Beach hit the market as a \u201ccoming soon\u201d property,\nasking $45 million\n. Canadian commercial real estate firm Wilson Terra Firma Holdings owns the nearly 13,000-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom home. It sits on a 0.7-acre waterfront lot.

Tiedemann Castle, a lakefront compound in Orange County\u2019s Greenwood Lake, was last listed at $6.3 million.\nIf closed at that asking price, the deal for the 9,000-square-foot home would break down to an even $700 per square foot.\nBuilt in the early 1900s to overlook the town\u2019s eponymous lake, the castle-like home has six bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a large turret and a replica of the Statue of Liberty. The house on the four-acre site, also has five kitchens \u2014 including an outdoor one \u2014 and an infinity pool.\nA limited liability company connected to Jeter purchased the property in the 2000s for a reported $1.6 million from a trust tied to his family. When his playing career ended, the long quest to sell the estate began.\n\nJeter and his wife, Hannah,\nlisted the 12,000-square-foot home\nin 2018 for $14.7 million, only to pull it from the market a year later. In 2021, the listing reappeared last year with a\n$2 million discount\n. In early 2022, it was relisted again for $9.5 million; an\nattempt to auction\nthe property followed, without any takers on the $6.5 million minimum bid.\n\nThe final sale price and buyer likely won\u2019t emerge until the deal closes. Wright Bros. Real Estate\u2019s Diane Mitchell had the listing.\nFollowing a Hall of Fame playing career spent exclusively with the Bronx Bombers, Jeter has dipped into numerous business pursuits, launching The Players\u2019 Tribune publication, serving as an MLB studio analyst for Fox and as chief executive officer of the Miami Marlins, a tenure that ended in February 2022 as he sold his 4 percent stake in the franchise.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "Billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel won approval for the design of a new house he plans to build on Miami Beach\u2019s Venetian Islands.\nMiami Beach\u2019s Design Review Board approved the project at a meeting in February, giving Thiel the OK to build anew on part of his waterfront estate. The tech mogul is splitting up his compound, demolishing one of the houses and replacing it with a modern 6,800-square-foot home, planning documents show. Thiel bought the homes at 441 and 445 East Rivo Alto Drive for\n$18 million\nin 2020 from\nformer Ford CEO Jacques Nasser\n. Since then, Thiel has hosted a number of parties and fundraising bashes for GOP politicians, according to published reports.\nThiel\nand his co-founders sold\nPayPal\nto eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002 and went on to launch the venture capital firm Founders Fund and data analytics giant Palantir Technologies. He was famously Facebook\u2019s first investor, and has advocated for young adults to forgo college and launch companies with his Thiel Fellowship. He has an estimated net worth of $7.2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe aging Venetian Islands compound includes two houses, two pools and 0.6 waterfront acres. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1947, and the 5,500-square-foot house at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive was built in 1956, according to property records. His approved plans show he intends to split the properties and build a new house at 441 East Rivo Alto Drive. The plans do not note his intentions for the adjacent home at 445 East Rivo Alto Drive.\nThe timing for the construction project is convenient. Thiel, a well-known libertarian who backed Donald Trump in the 2016 election, has declined to fund any politicians in the 2024 race \u2013\u2013 so no need for fundraising events.\nThiel\u2019s new house will include two offices, a guest bedroom and bathroom, nanny\u2019s quarters with a service entrance and three bedrooms fronting a playroom, the plans show. He and husband Matt Danzeisen share two daughters, according to published reports.\nThe house, designed by Leo Marmol and Rod Radziner\u2019s Los Angeles-based firm Marmol Radziner, will also have a redesigned pool and landscaping.\nSince Thiel bought his compound in 2020, the Venetian Islands have become a South Florida hub for the so-called \u201cPayPal Mafia\u201d and other Silicon Valley giants. Venture capitalist and PayPal alum Keith Rabois, an early bidder on LinkedIn, Square and Yelp, bought a Venetian Islands mansion\nfor $28.9 million\nin 2020. Famed WhatsApp investor Jim Goetz bought a pair of adjacent homes\nfor $29.6 million\nin 2017 and 2019.\nThis month, the\n$22.5 million sale\nof a Venetian Islands house was linked to \u201cPayPal Mafia\u201d member and venture capitalist David Sacks.",

        "content": "The Jumpman hung in the air with his real estate offering for over a decade, only to end up making a crash landing.\nAfter nearly\n13 years on the market\n, retired Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan\u2019s massive Highland Park mansion has finally sold for $9.5 million, significantly below its last asking price of $14.855 million.\nThe 56,000-square-foot home at 2700 Point Lane went through a series of price cuts over the years, becoming\na symbol of the difficulty sellers of ultra-luxury\nChicago-area real estate have had recouping their investments into properties.\nJordan\u2019s sale echoes the trend of high-end homeowners taking significant losses this year, including the $15.25 million sale of an estate in Lincoln Park previously listed at $50 million.\nThe buyer of Jordan\u2019s former home, doesn\u2019t appear to have been represented by a real estate agent, and remains unknown. Jordan\u2019s agent, Katherine Malkin of Compass, declined to comment to Crain\u2019s, which\nreported\nearlier Wednesday evening the sale had been finalized.\n\nJordan, a retired NBA Hall of Famer and billionaire, held onto the asking price \u2014 the digits of which added up to his jersey number 23 \u2014 for over nine years, despite multiple price cuts previously.\nThe 8.4-acre estate, built in 1995, boasts 15 full bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a regulation-sized basketball court and a circular infinity pool. However, the Lake County Assessor values the property at $4.94 million, which means the Jordan property\u2019s tax bill could double.\nJordan purchased the property for his then-wife Juanita Vanoy and their first children in the early 1990s. After their divorce in 2006, he maintained ownership and put the mansion on the market six years later, at first asking $29 million. Despite its luxurious features and unique tie to the legendary hooper, the property failed to attract a buyer at its initial price.\nHe cut the asking price twice in 2013 first to $21 million then $16 million, and even tried to hold an auction for it with a $13 million reserve price that year without making a deal, according to the\nChicago Tribune\n. Jordan had held the $14.855 million ask since 2015.\nThe sale is the fourth highest-priced home sale of the year in the Chicago area and highest-priced sale ever in Highland Park for a property not on Lake Michigan. Lakefront homes in Highland Park have sold for higher prices, but none have come with the chance to boast of owning Jordan\u2019s former home.\nIt remains unclear whether the house has been vacant or unused during its lengthy time on the market. Jordan reportedly owns multiple properties across the country, including homes in Florida, North Carolina, and Utah.",

That\u2019s the same address of the 30,500-square-foot Beverly Park mansion previously owned by Mark Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham, which sold last February for $55 million.\nThe unnamed owner of Wahlberg\u2019s former home is reportedly the same buyer behind the off-market acquisition of 2 Coral Ridge in Newport Coast, according to Robb Report. The October 2022 deal, also priced at $55 million and ranked as Orange County\u2019s priciest sale that year, involved the estate previously owned by reality TV stars Terry and Heather Dubrow.\nThe mystery buyer is tied to Gu Fang, wife of Chinese billionaire Xu Hang, according to Robb Report, citing anonymous sources. Hang\u2019s fortune comes from medical device maker Mindray Medical, which he co-founded.\nThe buyer scored deals in the case of the Beverly Park mansion, which sold for $32.5 million less than its listing price.\nIn the case of Rihanna\u2019s former condo, it sold last month for $20.8 million, or $4.2 million less than its original listing price. The music and fashion superstar, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, listed the condo in March.\nThe penthouse spans the entire 40th floor of The Century condominium tower at 1 West Century Drive.\n\nThe sale is subject to the City of Los Angeles\u2019 Measure ULA, which applies a 5.5 percent transfer tax on sellers of properties that trade for $10 million or more. That equates to $1.1 million in this deal.\nCarolwood\u2019s James Harris and David Parnes represented the seller, while Ginger Glass of Compass brokered the deal on behalf of the buyer.\nA total of four bedrooms and eight bathrooms make up the 9,300-square-foot condo.\nThe property touts 10-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass in the screening room and four terraces offering views ranging from Downtown L.A. to the Pacific Ocean.\nRelated Companies developed the 42-story condo tower, which counts 140 units on what was once the St. Regis Los Angeles. Robert A.M. Stern Architects served as architect of the 640,000-square-foot property.\nForbes currently estimates Rihanna\u2019s net worth at $1.4 billion. That accounts for revenue generated from Fenty Beauty, which is co-owned with French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessey, in addition to lingerie brand Savage x Fenty among other businesses.\n",

The purchase came with a $5 million mortgage.\nGronager, who abruptly stepped back from his post late last year, previously signed another public document on behalf of the purchasing entity, Cool and Perfect LLC. The company was used to buy a condo at 111 West 17th Street in Chelsea for $3.3 million in 2018.\nThe 3,800-square-foot home is finally trading more than a decade after sales launched at the landmarked building known as Cast Iron House. The\nNew York Post\nfirst reported news of the signed contract earlier this month but didn\u2019t include the identity of the buyer.\nThe four-bedroom penthouse last asked $12 million, down from just under $13 million when it hit the market with Ryan Serhant\u2019s eponymous firm in 2021, according to Streeteasy. The apartment was the last remaining sponsor unit at the building, developed by Knightsbridge Properties.\nThe home \u2014 and its 1,500-square-foot wraparound terrace \u2014 was featured in the\nreality TV show\nfollowing agents at Serhant\u2019s eponymous firm, which premiered on Netflix in June. In an episode of the show, Jordan Hurt, one of the listing brokers and cast members, described the penthouse as a \u201cMalibu Beach house in the middle of Manhattan.\u201d\nKrista Nickols, also with Serhant, represented the listing with Hurt and the firm\u2019s founder. The listing agents did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nA spokesperson for Gronager\u2019s firm did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe mortgage document lists a Miami Beach address that once belonged to the CEO of Related Group\u2019s multifamily division. Steve Patterson, and his wife Carly, sold the waterfront mansion at 2901 Flamingo Drive to an anonymous LLC called Flamingnet for\n$14.8 million\nin 2023. It\u2019s now\u00a0 under contract with a last asking price just under $18 million, according to Zillow.\nThe five-bedroom home is down the street from a lot owned by disgraced broker, Tal Alexander. The former co-founder of Official Partners paid $3.1 million for 2687 Flamingo Drive in 2020.\nSources told\nTRD\nthat Alexander family patriarch, spec home developer Shlomy Alexander, is\nquietly shopping the property\n, along with others owned by members of the family, while Tal and his two brothers, Oren and Alon, await their trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\nGronager co-founded Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, 10 years ago, alongside Jan M\u00f8ller and Jonathan Levin. The company tracks cryptocurrency transactions and \u201chas been used to solve some of the world\u2019s most high-profile criminal cases.\u201d\nGronager took a\nsudden leave of absence\nfrom the firm in October in a move the company described only as \u201ctemporary.\u201d His departure came a year after Chainalysis laid off 15 percent of its staff.\n",

He previously served as Gambino\u2019s own manager during his first years with Compass.\n\u201cMy goal is to build on the momentum [Gambino] has created, recruit, and continue to provide the unparalleled service we are known for,\u201d Berkeley wrote in a statement.\nIn his new role, Berkeley is tasked with adding new agents to the Gambino Group\u2019s 22-person fold and overseeing its operations across six markets in four states, including New York City, Los Angeles and Miami.\n\u201cHe understands how crucial it is to onboard agents who match our ethos,\u201d Gambino wrote in a statement.\n\nGambino\njumped to Compass\nin 2020 after five years with Kurt Rappaport and Stephen Shapiro\u2019s Westside Estate Agency based in Beverly Hills and Malibu. The following year, he\nexpanded to Miami\n, where he and his wife bought a home on Sunset Islands for $2.8 million. The couple sold the property for $5.7 million in 2023.\nGambino launched the New York arm of his business under Adam Modlin\u2019s brokerage, the Modlin Group, before\nmoving his team\nto Compass in 2022. The cohort now sells properties in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Hamptons, North Fork and New Jersey.\nIn 2023, Gambino and Rappaport represented Mark Wahlberg in the $55 million sale of his Beverly Park mansion, which initially asked $88 million when it hit the market the year prior. That year, he also sold a five-bedroom townhouse in the West Village for $23 million.\nLast week, the team found a buyer for a\ncondo at 199 Mott Street\n, which once belonged to celebrity couple Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner. The couple sold the apartment last year for $5.4 million, and it\u2019s since cycled through another deal for about the same price. Now Unit No. 2 is under contract with a last asking price of $5.9 million.\nThe group\u2019s listings include a $65 million mansion in Holmby Hills, California; a sprawling estate in Mahwah, New Jersey asking $33 million; and a five-bedroom townhouse in Midtown East priced at $32 million. The group also represents \u201cEntourage\u201d actor Jeremy Piven\u2019s Mount Olympus home, which\nhit the market\nearlier this year for $10 million.\n",

Reached for comment, a spokesperson for Schwartz called\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s report of the sale \u201cinaccurate,\u201d but declined to elaborate.\nSchwartz bought the apartment from real estate industry veteran David Feinberg, whose company Feinberg Properties bought, sold, rented and appraised real estate, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nThe co-op duplex, which is more than 5,000 square feet, was listed at $20 million when it went into contract in December. It had been priced as high as $39.5 million, in 2021, according to\nStreetEasy\n.\nThe four-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom unit features a private elevator which leads to a grand marble foyer entrance, wrought-iron staircase and walk-in coat closet. The home has a 53-foot-wide terrace overlooking Central Park, and 12 rooms, including a 39-foot-deep salon and library, both with fireplaces.\nSerhant\u2019s Ryan Serhant had the listing.\nThe 17-story, 19-unit limestone building has housed many of Manhattan\u2019s elite and their children. The daughter of Goldman Sachs\u2019 former head of merchant banking bought an apartment for roughly\n$25 million\nin 2020, and the son of Chanel chairman Alain Wertheimer snagged one for\n$19 million\nin 2019.\n\nFeinberg himself seems to have followed in the footsteps of his father Peter, who\nfounded\na real-estate investment and development company in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is across the street from the Emory Roth-designed building, also had an\napartment in the co-op\nfor its executives.\nThe penthouse purchase is apt for Schwartz, who shot to the top of the business world as an industry wunderkind. Schwartz joined investment firm 3G Capital in 2005 and made partner in 2008. The firm acquired Burger King for $4 billion in 2010 and appointed Schwartz as CFO; three years later, he was named CEO at the age of 32.\nUnder Schwartz\u2019 reign, Burger King became Restaurant Brands, which doubled its valuation from 2016 to 2019.\u00a0 Schwartz stepped back from the chief executive role in 2019. He remains on the board at Restaurant Brands and is a co-managing partner at 3G, according to\nLinkedIn\n.\nWhile leading Restaurant Brands, Schwartz was based out of Miami and Toronto, but told\nForbes\nhe planned to spend more time in 3G\u2019s New York office.\nThe penthouse deal adds to a slew of top-floor purchases. In the past two weeks, penthouses have accounted for a quarter of Manhattan luxury contracts, according to\nOlshan Realty\u2019s weekly report\n.\n",

It marks the most expensive residential sale in Miami-Dade County this year.\nAn undisclosed buyer is purchasing a smaller piece of the seller\u2019s holdings for $22 million, for a total sale price of $122 million, said Danny Hertzberg, one of the listing agents. That deal is expected to close soon, he said.\nKhubani, founder and CEO of Wayne, New Jersey-based consumer brands company Ideavillage, bought the properties at 18, 22 and 24 La Gorce Circle, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n. The undisclosed buyer is acquiring the property at 16 La Gorce Circle.\nKhubani\u2019s purchase marks the most expensive residential deal to close since hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin purchased Adrienne Arsht\u2019s former waterfront Miami estate for\n$106.9 million in 2022\n.\nThe La Gorce Island assemblage\nwent into contract\nin early April, sources said. It\nhit the market\ntwo years ago for $170 million.\nDanny and Jill Hertzberg and Jill Eber of The Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker represented the seller, the trust of the late Dr. M. Lee Pearce.\nBrett Harris of Douglas Elliman and Zach and Cody Vichinsky of Bespoke represented Khubani.\nHarris said the buyer is in the design phase to build a home for his family.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very happy with the location and the view and it\u2019s a legacy lot,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe looked here for almost\u00a0a decade. The reduction in price made the land attractive.\u201d\n\nDanny Hertzberg called it a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d that Miami \u201chas now had two $100 million sales\u2026 Pre-pandemic, $47 million was the record for years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUltra-high net worth people continue moving here,\u201d he added.\nIn April, Khubani sold a vacant oceanfront lot in Palm Beach\nfor $85 million\nin an off-market deal. His firm, Ideavillage, owns consumer goods brands Copper Fit and Microtouch, and he also invests in and acquires consumer brands through Ideavillage, according to Ideavillage\u2019s website.\nPearce, a controversial activist investor and a medical doctor, paid more than $3.1 million in the 1980s to assemble the properties, which total nearly 3 acres with about 600 feet of water frontage.\nKhubani likely plans to redevelop the properties.\nThe house at 18 La Gorce Circle has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a guest house. The two-story house at 22 La Gorce Circle has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and five half-bathrooms. The property at 24 La Gorce Circle is a park.\nThe two-story home at 16 La Gorce Circle has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. That lot was split off from the other three this summer.\nThe houses were built beginning in 1936, and each home has its own dock.\nIn June, spec developer Philippe Harari\u2019s AquaBlue Group sold the waterfront spec mansion at 98 La Gorce Circle\nfor $62.5 million\n. Jill Eber of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty brought the buyer.",

        "content": "After spearheading a remarkable post-pandemic turnaround, it appears as if the Brooks Brothers CEO has treated himself to a new pad.\nOne Grand 16s, a limited liability corporation tied to Ken Ohashi, paid $9.45 million, or roughly $2,700 per square foot, for a penthouse condo unit at 1 Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.\nThe 3,500-square-foot apartment went into contract in May after spending a little less than a month on the market,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nThe apartment has four beds and three baths, as well as 2,500 square feet of outdoor space, including a roof terrace. The unit also has a 60-foot living and dining room, renovated kitchen and floor-to-ceiling windows. It previously sold for $5.1 million in 2012.\nCompass\u2019 Libby Ryan, along with the Ryan + Ryan and The Leonard Steinberg teams had the listing.\nThe 15-story, 99-unit building designed by Richard Meier has a full-service staff, bike storage and parking. The all-glass building, which was developed by SDS Procida in 2005 and put on the market in 2008, was initially considered a failure, with the\nNew York Times\ncalling it \u201ca wall of windows into the real estate bust\u201d in 2009.\nThe property sold its first penthouse in 2011 for $3.97 million and by late summer 2012, the condominium building had\nsold out\n. Documentarian Ken Burns\nbought a three-bedroom unit\nfor $2.75 million in 2014.\n\nThe penthouse home is just blocks away from Ohashi\u2019s current residence at 168 St. Marks Avenue, located between Vanderbilt Avenue and Flatbush Avenue. Ohashi and his husband Adam Freed purchased the townhouse in 2015 for $4 million. The seven-bed, four-bath home is not currently on the market.\nOhashi\u2019s latest purchase comes after a whirlwind couple of years at the helm of the beleaguered fashion retailer, which sold to mall giant Simon Property Group and apparel licensing firm, Authentic Brands Group for $325 million in August 2020 after declaring bankruptcy. The company suffered from the pandemic-induced remote working culture, which slowed foot traffic and devalued retail brands that emphasized business casual attire.\nOhashi took the helm of Brooks Brothers in 2020, months after the fashion brand filed for bankruptcy.\nNearly four years later, Ohashi appears to have led the company back into its pre-pandemic,\nbillion-dollar sales echelon\n. Ohashi told\nAxios\nlast year that aggressive markdowns of underperforming lines and a pivot into sportswear were keys to the company\u2019s recovery.\nOhashi\u2019s neighborhood of choice, Prospect Heights, is also on the rise. The area has seen several large rental buildings shoot up in the past couple years, and its median sales price in June was up 22.4 percent year-over-year, according to\nRedfin\n.\n\nThis article has been updated to include the additional listing brokers attached to the deal.",

The price is under $322 per square foot. Zac Gideo of Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate has the listing.\nO\u2019Neal purchased the home, located in Gates of Prestonwood, for $1.22 million in 2022. Built in 2005, it features five bedrooms, high-end kitchen appliances, a library with a fireplace, an open-concept living space with views of the lagoon-style pool, walk-in attic spaces and a six-seat media room.\nThe move to sell his Carrollton estate comes after O\u2019Neal\u2019s recent\npurchase\nof a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in the property records, but the Rockwall Central Appraisal District shows the home\u2019s appraised value is $1.7 million.\nWhile O\u2019Neal primarily used his Carrollton home as a part-time residence, the location of his Rockwall County home will likely play a key role in helping him expand his chain of O\u2019Neal\u2019s Big Chicken restaurants throughout the region.\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s Carrollton home is being marketed by Gideo, who was also the buyer\u2019s agent for O\u2019Neal\u2019s home in Health, purchased in April through O\u2019Neal\u2019s the Chexy Trust.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth luxury market is having a strong year so far, according to the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&amp;M University.

He rose to boxing prominence promoting and arranging some of the sport\u2019s most famous fights featuring the late Muhammad Ali, considered the greatest boxing champion of all time. King also managed and promoted George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones Jr., among other world champs.\nA longtime Palm Beach County resident, King owns a former\nJai Alai fronton\nin Mangonia Park that he tried to sell in the mid-2010s to a potential buyer that proposed redeveloping the site into a mixed-use project featuring a sports facility, retail stores, restaurants, a hotel and vocational and charter schools.

Gross Foundation charity wasn\u2019t in the home for very long, moving in back in 2022 after construction was completed on the property.\nShe paid $20 million for the home in 2018 and then began a multi-year renovation.\nThe 6,569-square-foot house sits behind gates on a more than half-acre lot. It has a motor court, 12-foot ceilings, a dining room enveloped in glass, service kitchen, separate staff parking and high-tech security system.\n\nIn 2022, Gross sold her home at 960 North Alpine Drive, about a two-minute walk from her current listing, for $23.3 million. The four-bed, seven-bath home originally hit the market with a $38 million ask. Gross purchased the property in 2017 for $35 million in an off-market deal from Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi.\nGross still has a sizable real estate portfolio, which includes homes in Palm Desert and the Laguna Beach private community of Irvine Cove.\nForbes estimates Gross\u2019 net worth at about $1.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of that is estimated to have come from her divorce from Bill Gross, co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Company, known as PIMCO. The two divorced in 2017 after more than 30 years of marriage.\nThe 984 Alpine Drive home, if sold, would be among Beverly Hills\u2019 priciest deals so far this year.\nThe top trade in the city in 2024 is the $37.1 million sale of 1006 North Roxbury Drive in June.

Both are in gated communities.\nBrady has been entertaining offers for his property at 26 Indian Creek Island Road. The retired quarterback and businessman was reportedly close to selling the mansion for a price ranging from $150 million to $175 million.\nKoum and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton sold WhatsApp, a popular communications app, to Facebook\u2019s parent company, Menlo Park, California-based Meta, in 2014 for $19.3 billion. Koum is now worth nearly $17 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nSales activity in the ultra high-end coastal market in Miami-Dade County, including Miami Beach and Bal Harbour, has increased since the\npresidential election\n. Brokers say the limited inventory of turnkey homes is keeping prices high.\nSo far this year, at least three major deals have set or will set neighborhood records once they close. Todd Glaser and his partners are\nin contract to pay $105 million\nfor Sonny and Suzanne Kahn\u2019s waterfront home in Miami Beach, a deal that will mark a record for North Bay Road. Glaser is hoping to either flip the property or build a spec mansion that could hit the market for $250 million.\nIn Altos del Mar, a gated neighborhood in North Beach, the CEO of Sedano\u2019s Supermarkets sold his oceanfront home\nfor a record $35.6 million\nin an off-market deal.\nAnd earlier this year, developer Fatos Rosenberg sold a waterfront estate and the house across the street for $92.1 million. The\n$85.2 million sale\nof the larger property marked a record for Miami\u2019s Bay Point neighborhood.\n",

Still, the company is reserving the right to sell the property if it deems it beneficial for investors, ESPN said, citing Rally\u2019s regulatory filing.\n\nDetails over things like property taxes, property maintenance, insurance and other potential cost-sharing issues for investors were not available, but Petruzzo said Rally would likely, or at least could, cover such things for up to five years.\nWhile Rally may be confident that it can rally buyers, there\u2019s plenty of Midwestern skepticism in Commerce, where some residents remain unconvinced about the valuation of the property, suggesting that a similar home might typically sell for around $10,000.\nOthers in the town, including former mayor Michael Hart, are cautiously curious, having observed the constant stream of Mantle enthusiasts visiting the house daily, eager to be a part of the baseball legend\u2019s history.\nAmid the buzz around Mantle\u2019s childhood abode, some experts caution that fractional ownership, while providing a chance for participation in coveted assets, may not yield substantial financial gains, especially given the fluctuations seen in the trading of sports memorabilia.\nNonetheless, the appeal of Mantle\u2019s legacy in the world of baseball and collectibles persists, highlighted by the record-breaking $12.6 million sale of his 1952 Topps card in 2022.\nMantle famously played 18 years for the Yankees, amassing 536 home runs, three MVP awards and seven World Series titles, en route to a 110.2 career wins above replacement.\n\u2014\u00a0Ted Glanzer",

        "content": "The Carmel house owned by Clint Eastwood when he served as the Monterey County beach town\u2019s mayor has sold for just over $19.3 million, including commission fees, after\ncoming to market in August for $21 million\n.\nAt just 4,442 square feet, the four-bedroom, 4.5-bath home\u2019s price comes to about $4,350 per square foot. The 1920s-era Las Ondas Estate sits on about a quarter of an acre one street off of Carmel Beach.\nTim Allen\nat Coldwell Banker represented both sides of the deal and said the buyer and seller hit it off after meeting during a home tour and agreed on the sale that included the $18.5-million sale price and the $800,000 commission with a \u201chandshake deal.\u201d There were two other interested parties, he added.\n\u201cHe could have waited for more offers but sincerely appreciated the buyer\u2019s love for the property,\u201d Allen said.\nThe buyer was Carmel House LLC, according to property records.\n\nEastwood lived in the home in the 1980s and 90s, including the two-year stint he served as mayor from 1986 to 1988. He sold the home to retired investor Frederick O\u2019Such in 1996 for about $2.25 million, O\u2019Such told the Wall Street Journal when the home first came to market this summer. By 1998, he had spent another $2.5 million renovating the now-century-old Spanish Revival property. His improvements included a wine cellar in the home\u2019s basement, seismic upgrades, a new roof and windows, and an Arts and Crafts-inspired interior overhaul.\nO\u2019Such told the WSJ that he planned to move to a cottage at a nearby retirement community after the sale of the home that he bought with his wife Joanne and lived in as his primary residence, after relocating from Los Altos Hills. Joanne died in 2011, and he later married Nancy Fuhrman, a longtime real estate broker in Monterey County who kept her broker\u2019s license until she died in the home at the age of 84 in March this year, according to her obituary.\nAllen said \u201clegacy properties\u201d such as Las Ondas are \u201cirreplaceable\u201d and have a subjective value determined more by intangibles such as view, feel, privacy, and a very particular location, which in this case includes a secret back gate to the beach, than the physical \u201cbricks and mortar.\u201d This buyer appreciated those subjective aspects, as well as the design and quality construction of the home, he said.\nThis is not the first time Allen has negotiated deals where buyers pay for commissions on ultra luxury homes and he did not link the\nrecent passing of the NAR deadline\non agent commissions to the buyer footing the bill for the commissions in this case.\n\u201cCommissions have always been negotiable, and it is not uncommon in some more significant transactions that once a price is set, the buyer will agree to pay the commissions to reduce the sales price,\u201d he said.\n",

A Compass spokesperson said that Mahgerefteh admitted in an internal interview that he never met the player, but that the agent maintained the sellers made clear the unit was for the shortstop.\nMahgerefteh, who is out of the country, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA co-op board document McCullough provided to\nTRD\nshows that on the board application, Isabella and Michael Volpe and their daughter Olivia Volpe were listed as expected occupants.\n\u201cAt times Anthony will be visiting on occasion,\u201d it states. \u201cHe is a professional baseball player.\u201d\nThe Volpes\u2019 dog, a Labradoodle named Jedi, was also listed on the document.\nThe building, which is 21 minutes by subway from Yankee Stadium, doesn\u2019t appear to attract many high-profile residents. Former T-Mobile CEO John Legere sold his apartment there for $22 million in 2018.

The property, situated about an hour from Dallas-Fort Worth in Love County, Oklahoma, was last listed for $22.5 million by Dallas-based Icon Global Group.\nPreviously used by the Bradshaws for both their residence and quarter horse breeding operation, the ranch has found new owners in Red River Equine, a joint venture between Billy and Suzonne Franks of Texas and Chad and Tiffany Beus, recent transplants from Utah.\nThe Franks, known for operating the Three Nails Ranch near Fort Worth, expressed enthusiasm for the central geographical location of the ranch, convenient for their clientele and business expansion.\n\nThe ranch boasts an 8,600-square-foot main house with six bedrooms, a sizable swimming pool, stocked fishing lakes and ponds, and comprehensive horse care and livestock infrastructure.\nWhile under Bradshaw\u2019s ownership, the property served as a filming location for \u201cThe Bradshaw Bunch,\u201d a cable television show that aired for two seasons starting in 2020.\nBradshaw, who had moved his quarter horse breeding operation to a smaller Texas ranch near Saint Jo, commented on the emotional connection to the ranch: \u201cI loved this ranch so much, having built it from the ground up, so I was very tied to it.\u201d The decision to sell was influenced by factors such as his busy schedule, changing family needs, and commitments.\nIcon Global Group\u2019s Bernard Uechtritz, involved in marketing the property, highlighted the significance of the sale and the collaboration of various parties in facilitating the transaction. Notably, Icon Global is still actively marketing the Turkey Track Ranch in the Texas Panhandle, totaling almost 80,000 acres.\nThis sale marks another chapter in the real estate ventures of Terry Bradshaw, adding to the list of significant ranchlands recently marketed by Icon Global Group, including the notable sale of the W.T.

When his grandfather moved from Iowa to California, he started stringing together a portfolio of small properties, such as duplexes. Cantlay remembers times he and his grandfather would drive through neighborhoods on scouting trips after a long day at the golf course.\n\u201cI can remember being little, and we\u2019d go to the golf course. But then we had to stop off on a particular street 20 minutes away to go fix up a property,\u201d Cantlay said.\n\u201cOne time we were at a tournament and he just wanted to drive through the neighborhood, see what the neighborhood was about,\u201d Cantlay remembered. \u201cI was ready to go back to the hotel room and get some dinner, [not] go on a scouting trip for 90 minutes.\u201d\nHis grandfather was a mentor to him, Cantlay said, giving him his first taste of the industry. While he acknowledges that he\u2019s still green in terms of this next venture, he has some experience dabbling in multifamily and student housing investments.\n\n\u201cI want to walk before I start running,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201c I feel like this partnership gives me the opportunity to develop some experience.\u201d\nWhile LRE has strictly stuck with the multifamily sector since its launch in 2012, Londa said that was more opportunistic than anything. He sees potential expansion into student housing, senior housing, retail and logistics down the line. Londa doesn\u2019t think the firm will ever pivot away from multifamily, however, despite\nthe challenges\nfacing the sector.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA. It\u2019s in my background,\u201d Londa said. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s where a lot of capital investment is going.\u201d\nCantlay isn\u2019t abandoning his day job anytime soon. He\u2019s preparing for the Presidents Cup, an international competition where he\u2019ll represent the United States in Montreal at the end of the month.\nBut he\u2019s spending his free time getting his feet wet at LRE,learning about property assessments and all the factors that go into evaluating potential acquisitions. Londa also plans to deploy Cantlay to help raise capital and meet with investors.\nCantlay, who\u2019s earned tens of millions on the PGA Tour, said LRE will be a \u201csubstantial focus\u201d of his, while acknowledging that golf will remain his top priority. When he walks away from the game full-time, however, he sees real estate as a potential second career. Just not yet.\n\u201cHopefully that\u2019s a number of years away,\u201d Cantlay exclaimed.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article said Cantlay\u2019s grandfather moved from Iowa to Florida.",

        "content": "Will the City of Los Angeles designate Marilyn Monroe\u2019s former home in Brentwood a landmark, staving off the wrecking ball? Its owners and the public won\u2019t know for weeks.\nThe L.A. City Council has put off a vote on whether to name the house where the star of \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d died at 12305 5th Helena Drive a historic cultural monument, setting the vote for June 26,\nthe Los Angeles Daily News reported.\nCouncilwoman Traci Park, who represents the area, had introduced a motion in September to preserve the home when its owners sought to bulldoze it to expand their home next door.\nLast month, Brinah Milstein Bank and her husband, reality TV producer Roy Bank,\nsued the city\nfor their alleged right to demolish the Spanish hacienda-style home. On June 4, a judge tentatively denied their attempt.\n\u201cFollowing the recent court decision and pending litigation, as well as ongoing discussions between the City Attorney\u2019s Office and the property owners, I would like to continue the item \u2026 for good cause,\u201d said Park, who had requested the postponement.\nThe Banks bought the first and last home owned by the Hollywood siren in July for\n$8.35 million.\nThey bought the house next door, a 6,000-square-foot dwelling at 12306 6th Helena Drive, in 2016 for $8.2 million.\nBut their plans to raze the 2,900-square-foot Monroe home to make room to expand their house next door created an international outcry \u2014 and an order by the city to temporarily stave off the wrecking ball.\nDays after\nreports surfaced\nthat the century-old home faced demolition, the L.A. City Council in September rushed through a motion to consider\ndesignating the property a historic cultural monument\n, a move that would invalidate the demolition permits.\n\nIn January, the city\u2019s Cultural Heritage Commission approved the application to designate the home as a historic cultural monument. The council\u2019s Planning and Land Use Management Committee shortly followed suit.\nIn a written statement to\nThe Real Deal\nlast month, Milstein and Bank\u2019s attorney Peter Sheridan alleged the city had \u201cengaged in an illegal and unconstitutional conspiracy\u201d involving government officials and tour operators and violated the law \u201cwith regards to the quasi-judicial process required for evaluation of alleged historic cultural monuments.\u201d\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge James Chalfant issued a tentative ruling in favor of the city, calling the Milstein-Bank motion an \u201cill-disguised motion to win so that they can demolish the home and eliminate the historic cultural monument issue.\u201d\nThe couple would not suffer the irreparable harm they claim by being denied a preliminary injunction because the City Council will address the issue, according to Chalfant.\nMonroe bought the one-story, four-bedroom home in early 1962 for $77,500 \u2014 or roughly $790,000 in 2023 dollars \u2014 after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller. Less than six months later, the 36-year-old actress was found dead from a drug overdose in her bedroom.\nThe house\u2019s front step tiles read \u201cCursum Perficio\u201d \u2014 Latin for \u201cmy journey ends here.\u201d\n\u2014 Dana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "For some, Kanye West\u2019s former house in Malibu looks like a bunker on the beach after the rapper stripped the cement structure of finishes, plumbing and electrical wires.\nBut Belwood Investments owner Steven \u201cBo\u201d Belmont \u2014 whose firm finagled a steal, paying $21 million for 24844 Malibu Road \u2014 sees only upside: the sand and beach are still steps away and the foundation remains of the Tadao Ando-designed home.\nNow, it\u2019s just a matter of restoring the 4,000-square-foot house with help from Marmol Radziner, a design firm involved with the home\u2019s original construction in 2013 for financier Richard Sachs.\nMalibu Road, bought at a 60 percent discount from its January listing price, represents Belwood\u2019s largest single-family residential project to date. It\u2019s also the buzziest by virtue of the home\u2019s former owner and the treatment of the property by West, who now calls himself Ye. (See accompanying photo slideshow from a walk-through of the property.)\nThe high-profile transaction also brings to light the unusual business model Belwood uses to grow its investment portfolio. At its simplest, the company is a real estate flipper using a fractionalized investing model on its mostly residential and some commercial fix-up projects.\nWhere it gets interesting is the app platform Belwood uses to pool investors. These investors typically account for 20 percent of a property\u2019s acquisition financing. Belwood comes in with the remaining 80 percent, working with its stable of lenders. In the case of Malibu, it arranged financing with CV3 Financial Services, an El Segundo-based provider of bridge, rental and construction loans. Homes are rehabbed or restored and then resold, with the profit split between Belwood and the investors.\nWith Ye\u2019s former home, a total of 500 investors hopped on board to loan anywhere from $1,000 to $1 million.\nIt\u2019s technically not crowdfunding, Belmont explained, with individual investors acting as private lenders on a property. In return, those individuals are trustees until the real estate is sold.\nThe investors, to a certain extent, are part of the decision-making process on property work. Currently, they can leave comments about a project through the app. A new version expected to soon launch will add voting capabilities on certain finishes, such as painting the walls White Sand versus, say, White Linen, Belmont explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a white wall, but it gives them the opportunity to help decide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with the concrete, same for the roof and same for the front door.\u201d\nIn the case of Malibu, Belwood Investments expects to shell out $6 million to $8 million on an estimated 12- to 16-month renovation project.\nWhat works\nMalibu is the latest of Belwood\u2019s expanding Los Angeles market buys.\nThe firm\u2019s local under-construction portfolio includes the late singer-songwriter Bill Withers\u2019 home at 1614 Viewmont Drive in the Hollywood Hills, plus two other Viewmont Drive properties. There are also homes at 1925 and 1855 Loma Vista Drive in Beverly Hills. Belwood also has\u00a0 2201 Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills and 7610 Woodrow Wilson Drive near Laurel Canyon.\nBelmont said he isn\u2019t set on one price point over another: \u201cI buy properties that are $30 million. I buy properties that are $30,000.\u201d\n\nCoastal California, Florida and New York are all markets Belmont considers sustainable domestically.\n\u201cI don\u2019t go to Wyoming. I don\u2019t follow the shiny objects. That\u2019s not my thing because those [markets] are the most heavily impacted when the market shifts,\u201d he noted.\nWhile ensuring a property has good foundational elements that can lead to a quick sale, Belwood also looks for homes that are rentable as a safety net in the event of a market turn.\nThe strategy has largely remained intact since Belwood\u2019s start.\nBelmont, who originally began as a mortgage broker in the early 2000s, saw his mentors successfully flip homes during the subprime mortgage meltdown. He bought his first property in Antelope, north of Sacramento at 3052 Scotland Drive for $175,000. He handled all the work to educate himself on the process and pricing. He sold it for $350,000 three months later.\nHe flipped another two homes on his own before friends took note. They liked the idea of flipping but didn\u2019t want to do it full-time or put their retirement savings on the line. Belmont offered to handle half the purchase price, while his friends came up with the other half and they split the profits.\nThat process later opened up beyond Belmont\u2019s friends in what officially became Belwood, utilizing the app to keep investors informed of projects\u2019 progress.\n\u201cI designed it to be the anti-BlackRock or the anti-Blackstone,\u201d Belmont said. \u201cThis was designed to create a financial impact not only to the local investor but to the community.\u201d\nEyeing DTLA office\nThe company, which has corporate offices in Folsom, more recently opened a Newport Beach location and is now working on an Athens, Greece outpost.\nThe overseas strategy eyes properties in tourist areas as short-term rentals. The goal, unlike domestically, isn\u2019t to venture into suburban areas, Belmont said.\nFarther out, the 80/20 split in funding acquisitions is likely to shift. Belmont projected the firm will eventually move to cover 90 percent of a deal.\nIn the commercial space, Belwood expects next week to complete work on a golf course, set to be called Belmont Pines Golf Course north of Santa Rosa. There\u2019s also an RV park and a Calistoga motel.\nBelmont said flex space that can lead to conversions, or a mix of uses, are the focus near term.\nHe acknowledged the more he delves into commercial, the greater the complexities are in working with state and local governments. Still, he said he\u2019s sitting on the sidelines, eyeing Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 challenged office market in particular.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my eyes on the big, tall buildings with the graffiti all over them,\u201d Belmont said without naming Oceanwide Plaza. \u201cI would love to take that on. That\u2019s kind of a lofty goal.\u201d\n",

The sale of the home at 406 Centre Island Road in Oyster Bay closed only weeks after the estate hit the market for roughly $13.8 million.

        "content": "Never mind the glamorous addresses and eye-watering prices. If there\u2019s one takeaway from Los Angeles\u2019 most expensive residential deals, it\u2019s that 2024 was the year of Carolwood Estates.\nThe Beverly Hills boutique brokerage \u2014 started in late 2022 by Hilton &amp; Hyland alumni Drew Fenton and Ed Leyson, along with Nick Segal \u2014 participated in half of this year\u2019s top 10 deals.\nElsewhere in the market, and not surprisingly, Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport turned up in 2024\u2019s priciest transactions, including the No. 1 deal that set a new state record in May.\nHere are L.A. County\u2019s top residential deals, compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nResearch using\nTRD\nreporting, L.A. County Assessor records, Redfin, Homes.com and Compass.\n1. 33064 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu | Unknown | $210 million\nA Malibu estate once owned by Oakley founder Jim Jannard was catapulted to record-breaking status when it sold in May for $210 million.\nThe off-market deal, which created a new high for the state\u2019s residential sales, was brokered by Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport.\nJannard, whose wealth comes from the founding of eyewear brand Oakley and then camera company Red Digital Cinema, sold his 15,400-square-foot manse on 9.5 acres to an unknown buyer shielded behind a Delaware-registered LLC.\nThe eight-bed, 14-bath home was previously owned by Oaktree Capital billionaire Harold Marks, who sold the property to Jannard in 2012 for $75 million.\n2. 28106 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu | Laurene Powell Jobs | $94 million\nThe $94 million buy of 28106 Pacific Coast Highway was Malibu pad number four for Laurene Powell Jobs.\nThe widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs picked up the 1950s ranch-style home in a June off-market transaction that adds to three other compounds she owns right next to her latest acquisition. The unknown seller was a trust, according to property records.\nSpanning 6,400 square feet, the home has eight beds and six baths sitting on a lot with more than 4 acres.\n3. 312 North Faring Road, Los Angeles | Lapro Property | $65 million\nNick Molnar, co-founder of buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay, plunked down $65 million for a Holmby Hills manse named after comedian Fanny Brice.\nProperty records show Lapro Property bought the nearly 19,000-square-foot home. That entity was linked to Molnar after it sold a Century City penthouse in 2023 to Rihanna for $21 million.\nThe \u201cFunny Girl\u201d Estate was purchased from British singer Robbie Williams in an off-market deal. Williams moved into the property in 2022, after paying $49.5 million.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 James Harris and David Parnes represented both sides in the deal.\nThe Georgian-style house, designed by architect Oscar Shamamian counts seven beds and 11 baths.

The $62.8 million deal, at the time, was L.A. County\u2019s priciest before the summer\u2019s mega Malibu deals.\nA limited liability company named Starlight Capital bought the gated home, which sits on about 1.5 acres. The property includes a two-story entrance, cold plunge, infinity pool, outdoor kitchen and pickleball court.\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Andreas Elsenhans held the listing, while Haylen\u2019s Helen Chong and Susanna Leung represented the buyer.\n5. 24186 Case Court, Malibu | Malibu Case | $61 million\nThe spec mansion sitting on a bluff overlooking Malibu Colony Beach became the city\u2019s largest residential deal in 2024 when it closed in July.\nThe home with\u00a0 more than 10,500 square feet, named The Edge, was the first to sell in Unvarnished developer Scott Gillen\u2019s The Case community. Gillen\u2019s ultra-exclusive residential tract includes homes between 9,500 square feet and 12,000 square feet.\nProperty records show the buyer was a Chandler, Ariz.-based limited liability company called Malibu Case.\n\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Cooper Mount was the buyer\u2019s agent, while The Agency\u2019s Sandro Dazzan, Paul Lester, Daniel Stevenson and Aileen Comora had the listing.\nThe Edge has five beds and eight baths.

The $38.5 million sale of the Cape Cod-style home at 33740 Pacific Coast Highway kicked off the pricier activity of the year on this famed stretch of road.\nInvestors Mark Cirlin and Man Li-Yeh paid $10.7 million for the property in 2007 before selling it in March. Property records show the buyer was Andrew Schwartzberg, managing partner of Washington, D.C. affordable housing developer and investment firm Pennant Housing Group.\nChris Cortazzo of Compass along with Engel &amp; Voelkers\u2019 Nicole Van Parys and Gary Nese had the listing for the sellers.

The two-story, 7,300-square-foot home is in The Summit Club, a private community.\nWahlberg has talked a ton about moving his family to Las Vegas and turning it into a mecca for film production. His $14.5 million purchase of the townhouse last August exemplified him walking the walk.\nWhile it may seem odd for Wahlberg to suddenly flip the home in Las Vegas he owned for 13 months, the city hasn\u2019t seen the last of the multihyphenate. The Summit Club hasn\u2019t seen the last of him either, as Wahlberg owns 2.5 acres in the same community, buying the land for $15.6 million before the townhouse purchase; he may be looking to build a mansion of his own on that plot.\n\nThe anonymous buyer is getting much more than a two-story townhouse. They are also getting access to all of the amenities at the Summit Club, which includes a golf course, 24-hour security, wellness and recreation programs, snack stations, tennis courts and of course, pickleball courts.\nThis year, Wahlberg and his wife, Rhea Durham, also sold their 30,500-square-foot mansion in Beverly Park, California\nfor $55 million\n. That sum was $32.5 million below what the couple asked for the property when they\nput it on the market\nin April 2022 for $87.5 million; the Hollywood A-lister and his model wife bought the property for $8.2 million in 2009 before building their own mega-compound.\nWahlberg, a Boston native, is best known for his roles in movies such as \u201cBoogie Nights,\u201d \u201cThe Departed,\u201d \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and \u201cTed.\u201d He was also a member of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch in the 1990s, best known for their smash hit, \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A consortium of retired Argentinian sports stars, including NBA Hall of Famer and ex-soccer player Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, wants to build a $337 million mixed-use project on county-owned land in Homestead.\nA majority of Miami-Dade County commissioners last week authorized Mayor\nDaniella Levine Cava\nto negotiate a possible 99-year lease agreement with Ponte Vedra Beach-based VSGS Facilities for roughly 20 acres at 28451 Southwest 127th Avenue near Homestead Air Force Reserve Base.\nTwo commissioners,\nRaquel Regalado\nand Danielle Cohen Higgins, voted against the resolution after failing to defer the measure to allow more time to address concerns about the project.\nThe investment group would develop a complex entailing a 10,000-seat soccer stadium, a 38,000-square-foot basketball facility, a 200-bed student housing building, a 5,000-square-foot sports medicine center, a hotel with up to 150 rooms and sports fields, county documents show.\nCommissioners approved the project despite concerns about the potential impact the massive development would pose to the base\u2019s operations, and on separate federal plans to turn the air base into a space port for rocket launches. The project is also near 72 acres of protected park land.\nIn addition to Ginobili and Ver\u00f3n, other partners in VSGS include Dario Sala, ex-general manager of Jacksonville Armada FC, and Riccardo Silvia, president and co-owner of Miami FC, a soccer team in the USL Championship League, and co-owner of AC Milan soccer teams.\n\nThe 20 acres is within 123 acres of land that was previously part of the air base, but that the federal government deeded to the county in 2004. Miami-Dade planned to sell the entire 123 acres to a steel mill developer for $16.8 million in May 2019, but negotiations have stalled, county documents show.\nIn July, Miami-Dade exercised a clause in the steel mill agreement allowing the county to retain ownership of 20 acres and reduce the purchase price accordingly.\nMiami-Dade County commissioner Kionne McGhee sponsored the resolution for the VSGS project. During Thursday\u2019s county commission meeting, McGhee insisted that the air base,\nHomestead\ncity officials and surrounding municipalities would have input on the planned development before Levine Cava finishes negotiations.\n\u201cThis is not an item that is fully baked or fully inclusive,\u201d McGhee said. \u201cThe reason we allowed this item to go to the administration for due diligence is to give the people of south Dade the opportunity to bring forth their thoughts and concerns.\u201d\nRegalado and Higgins countered that they had received calls from local elected officials in\nsouth Miami-Dade\n, as well as business trade groups and residents, who said that the investment group had not met with them. Regalado noted she found out more about the project\u2019s details from the media than from county staff.\n\u201cIt does create a conflict for us,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cWe need to know how this impacts other areas and what the safeguards are.\u201d\nPeter England, chief strategy officer of the Economic Development Council of South Miami-Dade, said the proposal lacked a full vetting process. \u201cWe think there is a great deal of due diligence that needs to take place,\u201d England said. \u201cThe site has been designated as a space port territory by the state. There are also concerns by part of the base on how the project would impact its operations.\u201d",

Ben especially wants to be done with the house. He was never happy there.\u201d\nBroker Santiago Arana of The Agency has the listing.\nThe mansion has 12 bedrooms and 24 bathrooms. There\u2019s also a 5,000-square-foot guesthouse, a caretaker house and a two-bedroom guardhouse.\nThe estate includes basketball and pickleball courts, a gym, a boxing ring, plus a sports lounge and bar in what is billed as a \u201cone-of-a-kind indoor sports complex.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also a car collector\u2019s and party host\u2019s dream, with a 12-car garage \u2014 plus parking for 80 more vehicles.\n\nThe two-story white mansion, built on a promontory, overlooks what may be\nthe biggest zero-edge pool in town\n, at 155 feet long.\nThe French-style Wallingford Estate,\nbuilt in 2000\n, was modeled on Le Petit Trianon, Marie Antoinette\u2019s private ch\u00e2teau,\naccording to Forbes\n. It has a 5,300-square-foot master suite, plus a cinema, wine room and a whisky lounge. It also has a spa with a hair and nail salon, sauna, massage room and stylist area.\nIt was purchased by developer Gala Asher in November 2016 for $22 million, then revamped.\nIts prior owner, healthcare entrepreneur Jeoung Lee, bought the home after its previous owner, Curtis Somoza,\nwas caught in a $64 million Ponzi scheme\n, for which he was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison.\nAffleck has already moved out of the Beverly Hills Post Office estate and rents a smaller mansion in Brentwood for $100,000 a month \u2014 just two blocks from the home of his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner,\nthe Daily Mail said.\nLopez lives separately at an unknown location, according to US Weekly. \u201cNothing has been decided yet as far as the divorce, but selling the house is the first step,\u201d the insider said.\nAffleck and Garner share three children together: Violet, 18; Fin, 15; and Samuel, 12.

Ricky Rozay, dropped $35 million to acquire the waterfront Star Island estate he was in contract to purchase.\nThe Grammy-nominated rapper and record executive closed on the 12,400-square-foot mansion at 37 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach, according to the listing agents. Ross posted about the purchase on social media after he was\napproved by the Star Island homeowners association\nin mid-July.\nHis neighbor on the island, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, gifted Ross a golf cart, according to a post on Instagram.\nThe nearly 1-acre property was on the market for $37.5 million with a group of agents led by Coldwell Banker\u2019s Jill Eber and Jill Hertzberg, of The Jills Zeder Group. Kimberly Knausz with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented Ross.\nProperty records show longtime Oracle executive Yale Brown, now managing partner of Columbus Ventures, sold the home.

He grew up in the Carol City neighborhood of Miami Gardens and attended Miami Carol City Senior High School.\nHis Star Island home, built in 1992, features a large covered terrace, pool, summer kitchen and a Japanese Zen garden. The property has 100 feet of water frontage on Biscayne Bay and a 40-foot dock.\nStar Island\n, with about 30 homes, experienced turnover over the past three years as the luxury market boomed shortly after the pandemic began.\nNew owners include billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin, who began acquiring Star Island land in 2020. Last fall, he sold the lot at 14 Star Island Drive to former baseball star turned real estate investor Alex Rodriguez. The deed was recorded at $18.5 million, about $5.5 million less than Griffin had paid.\nIn October, Lennar Corporation Executive Chairman Stuart Miller\nsecured city approval\nfor the waterfront mega mansion planned for his 2.8-acre assemblage at 4, 5 and 6 Star Island Drive.

The 7,000-square-foot brick home includes four bedrooms, an oversized bay window and marble fireplace mantel in the living room, a private office, a gym and an in-law suite.\nWhile the Wallace family intends to keep a small home in the district, they are shifting their primary residence to Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nKalorama is arguably Washington\u2019s preeminent neighborhood for political movers and shakers.\nAmong those to live in the neighborhood have been former President Barack and first lady Michelle Obama, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Jeff Bezos \u2014 who paid\n$23 million\nin cash for the largest home in Washington, D.C. in 2017. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\nrecently moved\nto sell his own home in the neighborhood.\n\nConsidering the changing political landscape in the coming months, Wallace told the Journal it \u201cseemed like an appropriate time\u201d to sell the longtime D.C. abode.\nMichael Rankin of TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty holds the listing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

They met during a midseason game.\nMoody asked to parlay more at Shorenstein\u2019s luxurious Downtown office. Shorenstein obliged.\nThey met days later and Moody, 22, arrived with a notebook and an hour\u2019s worth of questions about real estate, according to the Chronicle. Among them: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to learn?\u201d\n\u201cHe was saying the best way to learn about it is to actually do it,\u201d Moody said. They agreed he\u2019d participate in the firm\u2019s internship program during the offseason.\n\nWhat resulted was a mostly weekday program in which the NBA shooter would suit down from sneakers and shorts into buttoned-up business attire after workouts at Chase Center.\nMoody learned industry software and terminology, attended meetings, happy hours, and what it took to develop properties.\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a humble guy. He acted like any other intern,\u201d Shorenstein, CEO of his eponymous firm, told the Chronicle. \u201cHe really put his head down, worked hard and acted like anybody else.\u201d\nAt the end of the internship\u2019s final week, Moody was invited to a Saturday birthday party in Little Rock, Ark., his hometown to which direct commercial flights are unavailable from San Francisco.\nShorenstein asked him when he was leaving. Friday night, Moody said, on a connecting red-eye through Denver.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave yesterday?\u201d Shorenstein asked him.\n\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to miss the last day of the internship,\u201d Moody said.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Bret Macy is a platform general manager with Lithia &amp; Driveway, a publicly traded car dealership network based in Medford, Oregon, his LinkedIn shows.\nVeroushka Volkert of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented both the buyers and the sellers. She declined to comment on the deal.\nSu\u00e1rez is widely considered one of the greatest strikers of his generation. The Uruguayan launched his professional career almost 20 years ago with Club Nacional de Football in Montevideo. He played with\nMessi\nat FC Barcelona from 2014 to 2020, and is rejoining his old teammate after signing a contract with Major League Soccer\u2019s Inter Miami in late December, according to published reports.\n\nThe teammates will also be neighbors in Fort Lauderdale. Messi bought a waterfront mansion at 91 Compass Lane in Bay Colony for\n$10.8 million\nin September, following months of swirling rumors over where the soccer star would settle with his family. In an unexpected twist, Messi, Su\u00e1rez and other Inter Miami stars have focused their purchases in two lesser-known gated communities,\nBay Colony\nand\nSea Ranch Lakes\n. Both have\n24-hour security\nand close proximity to the prestigious Pine Crest School.\nBret and Jamie Macy bought the Compass Point house for $3.6 million in 2020, records show. The couple completed an extensive renovation of the home, according to property records. Built in 1980 on 0.6 acres, the nearly 7,100-square-foot house has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, records show. The home spans 425 feet of waterfront, according to a previous listing.\nProperty records show the couple regularly invests in Broward County real estate. They bought a Fort Lauderdale condo for $365,000 in 2019, and a house in Coral Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale for $7.3 million earlier this month, records show.\nOther recent Fort Lauderdale deals include\nHewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Antonio Neri\u2019s $9 million sale\nof a waterfront house to a logistics chief. Neri had bought the house for $8.5 million in 2021.",

The deal included additional $2 million worth of furnishings and other items, the outlet reported\nShellie Dunlap of Lee Real Estate, represented the sellers, identified only as\u00a0 known as the MAK Daddy Trust and MAK Shack Trust, while Peter Engen of Lee Real Estate, represented Portnoy.\nThe 1.2-acre property, located in the Monomoy area, sprawls along the Nantucket Harbor waterfront. The owners bought two parcels in 2016 for a combined $13.3 million and custom-built the compound following the demolition of two existing homes.\nThe property now has a main residence designed by Andrew Kotchen of Workshop/APD, with\u00a0 four bedrooms and a primary suite with an indoor-outdoor shower and spectacular harbor views. The compound also includes a pool area and guest quarters, accessible via an underground tunnel.\nPortnoy, who is from Massachusetts, has previously invested in Nantucket real estate, having bought a property for around $2 million. He recently reacquired Barstool for $550 million after selling it to Penn Entertainment. He\u2019s also known for appearing in headlines nearly as much as his media company generates them. In 2021, he faced allegations of\nsexual misconduct\nfrom several women, which he denied.\nHe\u2019s also been accused of making misogynistic, sexist and racist harassing comments, which he has passed off as jokes, according to\nthe Washington Post\n.\n\nAt the same time, he\u2019s developed several wildly popular brands, including Barstool and the \u201c\nOne Bite Pizza Reviews\n,\u201d which he spun off into a festival that took place last weekend. He also has a rabid fanbase, known as Stoolies. His reviews can boost restaurant revenue up to 50 percent, the WaPo said, and a fund he created to support restaurants and small businesses during the pandemic raised millions of dollars.\nHe\u2019s also fond of buying beach homes.\nIn 2022,\nhe bought a beach house in the Hamptons\nfor $9.75 million.\nThe home sits on nearly a full acre of land, and the property includes a pool and a view of the ocean.\nCompass\u2019 Matt Breitenbach and Greg Gould represented both the buyer and seller in the off-market deal. Both declined requests for comment from The Real Deal on the transaction.\nIn 2021, he bought a bayfront Miami home for $14 million, a record for the city\u2019s Morningside neighborhood.\nThat home is about 6,100 square feet in size, built in 1939 on a 1-acre lot. It also includes a pool, as well as nine bedrooms and eight-and-a-half bathrooms.\n\u2014\nTed Glanzer",

It is the only branch office listed on the brokerage\u2019s DRE profile.\nNick Segal, Carolwood\u2019s managing broker, confirmed the company was opening a Montecito branch, but declined further comment.\nCarolwood co-founder Drew Fenton has long maintained an interest in Montecito. A closed sale listing for an $18 million estate, located at 710 Picacho Lane in Montecito, is posted on Fenton\u2019s\nwebsite\n.\n\nMontecito, positioned about 90 miles north of Los Angeles on a rugged coast near Santa Barbara, has long been a playground of celebrities and the ultra-wealthy. Los Angeles developer and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso owns the Miramar Beach Resort in Montecito. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have put their Montecito mansion on the market for $33.5 million, according to\nmedia reports\n.\nIn September 2022, De Generes sold a 12,000-square foot mansion for $36 million. One pricey Montecito estate, called Far Afield, was listed for $74 million in 2021; since June, the ask has dropped to about $60 million. The average price for a Montecito home is $6.3 million, according to Redfin.\nMontecito has long attracted the attention of Los Angeles area agents, but interest in the enclave increased during the pandemic, when many wealthy people sought second homes far away from metropolises, said Steve Clark, who is establishing an office for his Pasadena-headquartered Backbeat Homes in Santa Barbara. But breaking into the market is not easy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small community with not a lot of inventory,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe agents who work there are often third- and fourth-generation agents who aren\u2019t exactly interested in doing business with out-of-area agents.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The home of late TV journalist Barbara Walters has gone from the small screen to the silver screen.\nWalters\u2019 11-room apartment at 944 Fifth Avenue has been bought by an entity tied to former Disney president Michael Ovitz and his partner, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon.\nMichael S. Dreyer, as the trustee of the Zenpax Trust, closed on the co-op unit for $14.99 million on July 9, according to public records. Dreyer was listed as the chief financial officer of the Ovitz Family Foundation on its\nmost recent tax filing\n, and was the president of Artists Management Group, a previous Ovitz-led venture, according to\nVariety\n.\nOvitz and Mellon, who have been\nengaged since 2014\n, have both been active in the market for the past several years.\nIn 2022, Ovitz listed his West Village condominium at 155 West 11th Street for $25 million less than six months after buying it for $22 million from rock star Jon Bon Jovi.\nOvitz, who co-founded Creative Artists Agency in 1975 and departed for Disney in 1995, also sold an apartment complex for\n$58 million in 2023\n, almost $8 million less than he paid for it in 2017.\nMellon sold her penthouse apartment for just over $19 million in 2023. In 2008, the\nBritish fashion entrepreneur\n, who founded her own eponymous footwear brand, bought the pad for $20 million. The condo unit had appeared sporadically on the market since being listed for $34 million in 2014.\nDreyer could not be reached for comment.\nWalters lived in her Fifth Avenue co-op for 30 years until her death in December 2022. The home was\ninitially listed\nby her estate for $19.75 million in April 2023.\n\nThe price was dropped to $17.8 million in September and the unit went into contract toward the start of November,\nCrain\u2019s reported\n.\nAt the time of the listing, Alexa Lambert of Compass told the\nWall Street Journal\nthat the Upper East Side home had two bedrooms but could be easily converted to a four-bedroom. The main bedroom has views of Central Park, and the apartment has four bathrooms and two half bathrooms. It is serviced by a private elevator that opens to a main foyer and 42-foot living area and library.\nLambert declined to comment on any details of the sale.\nWalters, as the first female anchor of a nighttime network news program, was a trailblazer in the television industry. She interviewed many of the most influential figures over six decades, including every sitting president and first lady from Richard and Pat Nixon to Barack and Michelle Obama.\nIn her memoir, Walters wrote about frequently hosting at her apartment, including having Monica Lewinsky over for dinner several times before she agreed to an interview about the Clinton sex scandal.\nThe 14-story cooperative building has had several other prominent New Yorkers walk its hallways, including the late Broadway performer Isabelle Stevenson and Robert Mnuchin, the art dealer and father of former Treasury secretary Steven Munchin.\nMnuchin sold his unit in 2022 to RFR Realty principal Michael Fuchs for\n$18 million\nafter listing it for $25 million in\nOctober 2021\n.\nThe Manhattan market has been wobbly for the past several years, experiencing drops in median sale price in six of the past seven quarters. Things began to turn around\nlast quarter\nas listing inventory increased for the first time in 15 months and sales grew 12.2 percent year-over-year.\n",

The company entered brick-and-mortar in 2017 with a permanent store in New York that kickstarted its physical retail expansion. Two years later, The RealReal raised $300 million in an initial public offering.\nThe 4,500-square-foot Haynes Avenue home sits on over half an acre lot that\u2019s gated for privacy. It counts five bedrooms and five-and-a-half baths. Inside is Terrazzo flooring and a private wing housing the primary suite. Outside amenities include a teakwood deck, infinity pool and views of Trousdale Estates.\nHaynes Avenue marks another Trousdale transaction for Flagg in recent months.\nThe home is less than a mile from\n1875 Carla Ridge\n, the former home of singer Charlie Puth. Flagg bought the Mid-Century Modern in the fall, paying an undisclosed sum in an off-market deal, sources told\nTRD\nat the time.\nPuth paid $9 million for the more than 4,400-square-foot home in 2017. He listed it last November for nearly $17 million before reducing the price, with the most recent ask before it went into contract at just under $11 million.\n",

In a deal that feels very \u201cB**ch Better Have My Money,\u201d Rihanna\u2019s former home in the city sold for a record $33.4 million.\nThe sale marks the priciest home ever sold in London\u2019s St. John\u2019s Wood neighborhood, and the most expensive home sale in North London this year, The\nGuardian\nreported. The buyers are a wealthy Chinese family, pointing to a trend of Chinese buyers looking to the city\u2019s real estate as a contingency plan in the wake of the pandemic, according to the outlet.\nStephen Lindsay, an agent with Savills, and Mark Pollack of Aston Chase, brokered the deal, according to published reports. The deal is an example for Chinese buyers\u2019 growing demand for luxury London homes in recent years, Pollack told the outlet.\n\u201cMany wealthy Chinese and Hong Kong residents are prioritizing a \u2018plan B\u2019 in the eventuality of another unforeseen event leading to the Chinese government restricting movement,\u201d he told the outlet.\nGiven its history, the 6,300-square-foot St. John\u2019s Wood home should be dubbed the House of Diamonds.\n\nThe five-story, eight-bedroom home was built in 1844 by William Holme Twentyman and designed by royal architect John Shaw. The home\u2019s first owner was De Beer diamond baron Daniel Francis.\nMore than a century later, \u201cDiamonds\u201d singer, fashion designer and billionaire beauty mogul\nRihanna\n, rented the home for a reported \u00a318,000 (about $23,000) a week from 2018 to 2020, according to\nHouse Beautiful\n. Today, it includes multiple dining rooms, a gym and approved plans to expand with a pool and spa facilities, The Guardian reported.\nIt hit the market in 2020 for \u00a332 million, or nearly $40 million. The sale price is \u00a35 million, or $6.2 million, below the initial asking price. London is among\nthe world\u2019s trophy real estate markets\n, one of the few cities where the rich and powerful regularly buy homes for more than $50 million.

The singer has an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion, according to Forbes, and in April\ndropped $21 million\non a Century City penthouse for herself, partner A$AP Rocky, and their two children.

        "content": "Zoom CEO and founder Eric Yuan is in a legal battle over an Atherton home that he agreed to buy from builder Ali Sadeghi for $37 million in early 2021 but never actually closed on,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe LLC he used to transact on 88 Tuscaloosa Avenue sued last August, claiming construction costs and timelines went far beyond initial estimates, and Sadeghi requested another $8.14 million to complete the project, according to court documents filed with California Superior Court.\nThe suit names Sadeghi and his affiliated companies, as well as Pierre and Liz Buljan, who provided a $2.5 million loan guarantee for the construction, as defendants, and alleges breach of contract and breach of guarantee, among other things.\nThe LLC, controlled by Yuan, is asking for relief on nearly $32.5 million in secured and unsecured debt, plus $5 million in interest, as well as a foreclosure on the property to assure the debt is paid off.\nBut the litigation didn\u2019t stop there.\nIn November, the Buljans, who are Peninsula-based Compass agents, countersued, alleging that Sadeghi; Yuan and his wife Sherry, also known as Hongyu Zhong; and their agents, Delia Fei and Ron Gable, who are also with Compass, misled the couple about the state of the project and how much of an impact the $2.5 million guarantee would have on closing escrow.\n\u201cThese parties never intended for the loan Mr. Buljan guaranteed to be used to complete construction and close escrow,\u201d according to the countersuit.\nIn a cross-complaint, the Yuans denied those allegations, saying Buljan \u201chad made a complete investigation and was aware of the true facts and circumstances.\u201d\nIn late April, attorneys for all parties appeared \u2014 over Zoom, appropriately enough \u2014 at a hearing where the Yuans\u2019 attorney, Daniel Chung with Spencer Fane, informed the court that the plaintiffs have depositions and discovery pending. The case was continued until July 25. Chung and attorneys for the Buljans and Sadeghi did not respond to requests for comment. Fei and Gable declined to comment.\nThe pending litigation has not stopped the 1.3-acre, seemingly completed property from coming to market with a nearly $55 million dollar price tag.\nCompass agents Mary and Brent Gullixson have the listing and declined to comment on the suits or the property.\nThe listing website for the property describes \u201cjust completed extraordinary new construction\u201d centered around a main residence with 14,700 square feet, including a two-car garage.\nIt has eight bedrooms, 10 full baths, three half-baths, a home theater and fitness center, and 11-foot ceilings on the main and lower levels.\nThe amenities are also plentiful: a two-car detached garage and a two-car carport, all wired for electric vehicle charging; a poolside cabana with a fireplace and bathroom; a saltwater pool with spa and glass wall; a tennis/pickleball court; and a fruit and vegetable garden.\nA failed escrow\n\nSadeghi bought the property from its long-time owners for $8.1 million in 2016 through Linda Flora Holdings LLC, according to public records.\nIn 2018, he filed permits to demolish the existing property and build a new one, which he estimated would cost about $4.7 million for the main residence, according to city permits.\nThe Yuans, through an LLC named Marigoldyzp, signed on to buy the property in early 2021, putting down a $1.1 million deposit, court documents show. To fund the construction, Marigoldyzp signed onto a $28.4 million loan.\nIn March 2022, Atherton issued a Stop Notice because the construction was not yet complete and had gone beyond the allowable time line for the 2018 permit.\nIn order to get the project going again, Sadeghi asked the Buljans in October 2022 to guarantee the $2.5 million loan, which contained a stipulation that work had to be completed by April 30, 2023.\nThe Yuans also made several smaller additional payments to Sadeghi for construction, according to the complaint, but balked when he asked for an additional $8.14 million in July of 2023 to complete the project and pay for ongoing costs.\nSadeghi \u201cknowingly participated in a scheme that he knew would result in harm\u201d to Yuans\u2019 LLC, \u201cin order to obtain a continual flow of liquidity he could access to pay personal and business expenses,\u201d according to the suit.\nWhen Marigoldyzp refused to hand over more to finish construction, Sadeghi allegedly stopped construction and refused to close escrow.\nIn an email to agent Ron Gable explaining the need for the additional millions, Sadeghi argued that the $8.14 million simply covered carrying costs including mortgages, debt costs, property taxes, insurance and utilities since the Yuans entered into contract on the home in 2021, court records show.\n\u201cIt has cost millions of dollars a year simply to keep the lights on at 88 [Tuscaloosa] and it\u2019s not fair for me to get buried and lose my health as a result,\u201d Sadeghi said in the email.\nHe added that \u201cCovid, a lengthy payment process, hundreds of changes and meetings, and other unforeseen factors have caused construction to stop and start over and over again.\u201d\nHe closed out his request by saying, \u201cWe need an outcome where BOTH sides can walk away healthy, safe and with their shirt on their back. As it stands now, I can\u2019t afford to close this deal and this process has stretched me out to the point that it is literally killing me.\u201d\n\nThe Buljans countersuit also paints a similar picture, one where the Yuans\u2019 \u201csignificant changes\u201d drove up both the costs and timeline of the project.\nThe Yuans allegedly strung Sadeghi along by promising him \u201cvarious extrinsic business deals, including other real estate development, to induce him to continue work on the property,\u201d the countersuit said.\n\u201cAli Sadeghi was willing to continue incurring these costs because Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan were continually promising him that he would be able to make money in other ways outside the transaction through developing a personal and business relationship with Eric Yuan and Sherry Yuan,\u201d it went on. \u201cAll this time no party sought to close the escrow on the purchase of the property.\u201d",

Discovery listed his home at 34 West 11th Street for $21.9 million, Curbed\nreported\n. The listing price works out to roughly $3,835 per square foot.\nThe 22-foot-wide, four-story home has four bedrooms. The home has multiple fireplaces and a terrace on the top floor, and a backyard that can be seen from the living room.\nZaslav renovated the Green Revival home, raising the ceilings of the lower floors, adding windows and installing an elevator.\nZaslav bought the home in 2016 for $11.8 million, before spending an unspecified amount on renovations. He\u2019s been marketing the property on and off since 2020, including listing the property\nfor $25 million\nin the summer of 2023; Zaslav\u2019s first listing was for $17 million, according to\nZillow\n.\n\nA Corcoran team including Deborah Grubman and David Adler have the\nlisting\n. Agents from Sotheby\u2019s previously had the listing.\nZaslav has plenty of real estate ties to New York City, not to mention his company, which leases 1.5 million square feet at 30 Hudson Yards (though it recently\nsubleased a chunk\nof that to trading firm Susquehanna International Group).\nIn 2010, he bought a duplex on Central Park West from another entertainment figure, Conan O\u2019Brien, for $25 million. Zaslav also once rented another townhouse in Greenwich Village while renovations were happening at 34 West 11th Street; lore has it that the rental is where Zaslav negotiated the acquisition of Warner Media in 2021.\nDown the street, a townhouse sold last year at 138-140 West 11th Street\nfor $72.5 million\nin an off-market deal, representing a record for the Downtown Manhattan townhouse market.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Writer and director John Hughes is best known for two things: teen comedies, where he earned his stripes (\u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d); and holiday movies (\u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cPlanes Trains and Automobiles\u201d).\nHis best-known family films in both genres also evoke a warmth and coziness, which is due in no small part to where they\u2019re set: Chicago\u2019s wealthiest suburbs that reflect Midwest white-collar success and serve as a stage for the shenanigans that unfold in Hughes\u2019 films.\nIndeed, Winnetka, Illinois, (where \u201cHome Alone\u201d is set) and its surrounding towns have the priciest homes in Illinois, according to Realtor.com, with a median price of $1.65 million, and one listing going for $8.9 million.\nWhile real estate agents don\u2019t have to worry about the Wet Bandits or Principal Ed Rooney dropping by (or breaking in), they do have to worry about spiking interest rates, low inventory and a more sluggish residential market, even in such a prominent area as Winnetka.\nStill, even in a down market the idyllic homes in Hughes\u2019 films would generate interest. And with the holiday season in full swing, and \u201cHome Alone\u201d and \u201cPlanes Trains and Automobiles\u201d in full rotation,\nThe Real Deal\nasked North Shore agents how some of the most iconic of the bunch would do if they hit the market.\n\u201cHome Alone\u201d (671 Lincoln Avenue, Winnetka, Illinois)\nHughes, who wrote but did not direct this 1990 holiday classic, picked quintessential North Shore homes in most of his work for a reason, according to @properties Jena Radnay.\n\u201cYou know how the family is living, you know exactly where the bedrooms are going to be because he wants to give viewers the comfort that there is nothing to them that would make them feel uncomfortable about how these characters live in these houses,\u201d she said.\nThe 5,400-square-foot McCallister home, where Kevin thwarted two bumbling would-be burglars certainly fits that description. The 1920-built red-brick Colonial last sold for $1.5 million. It has 10 bedrooms, six bathrooms and has gone under a significant renovation within the past couple of years.\nRadnay says if the home were listed today, it would likely sell in the upper $3 million range.\n\u201cPlanes Trains and Automobiles\u201d (230 Oxford Road, Kenilworth, Illinois)\nThe home in the 1988 Thanksgiving classic road trip comedy belonged to Steve Martin\u2019s character, Neal Page, and he endured a series of pitfalls and follies on his way back from New York to get there.\nAnother red-brick Colonial, the 107-year-old six-bedroom sits on one-third of an acre in Kenilworth, about an hour outside of Chicago. And interestingly enough it is owned by a real estate agent, John Mawicke of @properties, who bought it in 2009.\nI grew up in town; my mom was a local realtor, he said. \u201cIt seemed like [the house] got to a mispriced number [$1.3 million], so we got to that number.\u201d (He paid $1.4 million)\nMawicke, 56, says he is a fan of the movie and gets a handful of visitors \u2014\u00a0some from as far away as California and Canada \u2014 every year looking to take photos or just get a peek of Hollywood history. Some are more passionate than others, like the woman who dressed in costume and shot a YouTube video out front, all of which Mawicke takes in stride.\n\u201cIf you buy a house like that you\u2019ve got no choice but to embrace it,\u201d he said, adding that he lives about 3/4 of a mile from New Trier High School, which inspired Hughes to write \u201cThe Breakfast Club.\u201d\n\nNot that he\u2019s looking to, but Mawicke says if he were to sell his house today, it\u2019d likely fetch about $2 million due to some of the work he\u2019s done on the home \u2014\u00a0including a new kitchen \u2014 and also because of the tight supply in the area.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no inventory in town, so who knows?\u201d he said, though a 6,500-square-foot, six-bedroom, five-bathroom house a few doors down at 244 Oxford Road sold for $2.2 million in 2022\n\u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d (370 Beech Street, Highland Park, Illinois)\nThe antithesis of what a typical Hughes home looks like, this four-bedroom, four-bath steel and glass ranch overlooking a ravine is where Ferris friend Cam Frye lived, and where that sweet 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder convertible died in the 1986 movie.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a watcher-in-the-woods house; it\u2019s sitting up in the ravine,\u201d Radnay said. \u201cIt\u2019s a showcase house, it\u2019s a display house. It is exactly what Cam isn\u2019t as a friend but yet his parents are. It\u2019s why Ferris is best friends with him.\u201d\nThe 1953 home, about a 40-minute drive from Chicago, sold in 2014 for $1 million, and Radnay says it would go for about $2.2 million today. That\u2019s quite a turnaround from the beginning of the 2010s, when the home was listed and couldn\u2019t find a buyer, mostly because it wasn\u2019t liveable,\naccording to DNA Info\n. The house couldn\u2019t keep an inside temperature of more than 52 degrees because of the windows. After an extensive renovation, both inside and underneath the home, it\u2019s now functional and marketable \u2014 Radnay says now more than ever.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ranch, so people love them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s desirable, and there is a need now for efficient, one floor living. It\u2019s a great house for an empty nester. It\u2019s on the North Shore, it\u2019s on a lake, it\u2019s very marketable today.\u201d There aren\u2019t many apples-to-apples comparisons of homes in\n\u201c16 Candles\u201d (3018 Payne Street, Evanston, IL)\nRadnay said the opening line in \u201c16 Candles\u201d (\u201cGinny, Mike, Sarah Sam! Come on! everybody up!\u201d) is one of the most famous lines in the movie because it showcases that a big family lives in the 3,250-square-foot, six bedroom, six bathroom home with a walk-up path to the door.\n\u201cThey have that front entrance, mom is holding a briefcase, it\u2019s the quintessential American family,\u201d she said. \u201c[The home is] not too big, not too small. Out of all the houses he shot, it\u2019s the smallest one.\u201d\nWhile some of the film\u2019s aspects haven\u2019t held up (we\u2019re looking at you, Long Duk Dong), the house, about a 30-minute drive from Chicago, remains highly desirable because of its location and the tight market. A five-bedroom, six-bathroom home a few doors down at 3022 Payne Street sold for $1.6 million in 2022.\nRadnay says she could get a bit more.\n\u201cIt listed for $1.7 million a few years ago, it\u2019d probably go for just under $2 million today,\u201d Radnay said.\n\u201cUncle Buck\u201d (2602 Lincoln Street, Evanston, Illinois)\nAnother traditional selection that shows the family \u2014\u00a0the children of which are under Uncle Buck\u2019s care \u2014 has a little more money and stature, according to Radnay.\n\u201cThe arch here is a cedar clapboard, it\u2019s very traditional,\u201d Radnay said. \u201c[Hughes] wanted to portray a house that was quaint, but someone could get lost not knowing where to go.\nRadnay said the 1924 four-bedroom, five bathroom, 5,200-square-foot home on about one-third of an acre would likely go for about $2 million, though with a caveat that there haven\u2019t been a lot of transactions in that well-to-do area of Evanston. A 2,900-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bathroom home a few blocks away is listed for $1.6 million.\nRadnay believes the \u201cUncle Buck\u201d home would still sell quickly in today\u2019s market.",

        "content": "Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband, actor and broker Archie Drury, are suing the Fisher Island Club, alleging in a dramatic lawsuit that the board has been acting illegally and used intimidation tactics to threaten the couple, forcing them to leave the ritzy enclave.\nThe couple was recently expelled from the membership-only Fisher Island Club. The board, Kurkova and Drury allege, has been operating under amended bylaws that are invalid.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court last week, also alleges that two of the five board members have engaged in self-dealing, using their positions to gain new development business that would or already is benefitting Douglas Elliman. The two\nboard members\nare David Chene, co-founder and co-managing partner of asset management firm\nKennedy Lewis\n, who serves as chairman of Douglas Elliman\u2019s board of directors; and financial services executive Mark Zeitchick, also on Elliman\u2019s board.\nElliman, the lawsuit alleges, wants to position itself as the exclusive broker for the last remaining undeveloped parcel on\nFisher Island\n, which\nTransMontaigne Partners is selling\nto a developer. Elliman is the exclusive broker for Madar Group\u2019s Residences at Six Fisher Island. The lawsuit alleges that Related Group may be the mystery buyer purchasing TransMontaigne\u2019s site. (That sale could close in May.)\nFisher Island Club said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat it denies all the allegations made in the complaint, which it calls \u201cnothing more than disgruntled former members.\u201d It said the plaintiffs were expelled based on their alleged attempt to defraud the club and circumvent its rules.\n\u201cAllegations by plaintiffs that certain club board members used their influence for personal or corporate gain are patently false, unjustified and are nothing short of scandalmongering,\u201d the statement reads.\nDouglas Elliman declined to comment. Chene and Zeitchick did not respond to requests for comment.\nDrury alleges that the issues with Fisher Island Club started when Drury left Elliman, where he was an agent, at the end of 2022. Drury is now licensed with the Side-backed NobleRoc Real Estate. Kurkova and Drury had lived on Fisher Island with their children for many years, according to the complaint. Their two club memberships, each costing $250,000, were purchased in 2013 and 2018.\nTwo LLCs owned by Kurkova and Drury own six condos on Fisher Island, at Marina Village 1 and 2, and Seaside Villas, records show. They paid a combined $5.2 million for the units between 2013 and 2022.\nThe club is subject to state laws governing nonprofits. It\u2019s not a homeowners\u2019 or condo association, but it\u2019s central to living on the island, one of the wealthiest pockets of South Florida. The club\u2019s amenities include a beach club, championship golf course, tennis courts, marinas, restaurants, a spa, fitness center, theater and more.\nResidents on the island have included tennis pro Caroline Wozniacki and her husband, former NBA player David Lee; Oprah Winfrey; actress Julia Roberts; and former\nElliman\nCEO Howard Lorber. The billionaires\u2019 playground is only accessible by boat, ferry or helicopter.\nA spokesperson for Kurkova said her experience on Fisher Island \u201chighlights the urgent need for state lawmakers and the [Department of Business and Professional Regulation] to step in, enforce compliance and protect property rights.\u201d\nDrury, Kurkova and two LLCs they own allege that the board, including its General Counsel Desiree Cuason, have been operating without a valid board of directors, failed to comply with valid bylaws, and breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to club members. Drury and Kurkova allege they\u2019ve been deprived of their property rights and cite damages in the millions of dollars.\n\u201cFlorida\u2019s private clubs and HOAs wield unchecked power, leaving property owners exposed to unfair governance, financial exploitation and rule by self-interested boards,\u201d Kurkova\u2019s spokesperson wrote in a statement. \u201cWithout immediate reform, these organizations will continue to operate as unregulated fiefdoms \u2014 putting homeowners, businesses and Florida\u2019s real estate market at risk.\u201d\nOn Monday, a few days after the lawsuit was filed, the club sent an email stating that its third amended bylaws, which Drury and Kurkova allege are invalid, are valid. Those bylaws, which the club said it passed in 2020, reduced the number of directors on the board to five from seven, among other changes.\nIntimidation tactics\nJennifer Atlman, Drury and Kurkova\u2019s attorney, said the third amended bylaws \u201cdetrimentally impact\u201d residents. The second amended bylaws, she said, do not allow for successive terms, while the latest version does. The latest version also states that if members sue the club, they will be expelled, Altman said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because this is a place where people should be able to go and really enjoy their life,\u201d Altman said.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Chene and/or Zeitchick approached Kurkova and Drury\u2019s now-former employee, \u201ccornered him and patted him down to ensure he did not have a recording device and threatened him.\u201d Chene and/or Zeitchick allegedly told this person \u201cif he did not provide false testimony against plaintiff Drury he would simply be \u2018collateral damage.\u2019\u201d\nClick to view the complaint by Karolina Kurkova and Archie Drury\nIn November 2023, Drury was informed via letter that he allegedly \u201cengaged in inappropriate conduct towards the club, other club members, and /or club members\u2019 property over the preceding two years,\u201d but failed to identify the conduct, according to the lawsuit. In a follow-up, the club\u2019s general counsel, Cuason, referred to a time when Drury accidentally got into another Fisher Island resident\u2019s white Range Rover instead of his own. When he realized he was in the wrong car, he turned around.\n\u201cIt was an innocent mistake in taking the wrong identical vehicle, it was not taken off the Fisher Island premises and the owner of the vehicle did not press charges, acknowledging it was inadvertent and not a theft,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Still, Drury was suspended for six months.\nEven if he intentionally took the wrong Range Rover, it didn\u2019t happen on club premises. \u201cDefendant had no jurisdiction of the claimed infractions even if the allegations were true,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nDrury\u2019s second suspension occurred two weeks after the first went into effect, after he ordered takeout for his daughter on Christmas Eve from La Trattoria, which is part of the club. Kurkova was not on the island.\n\u201cDrury received a letter from Ms. Cuason \u2014 again not in a manner prescribed by Florida Statutes but by email \u2014 advising him that he committed a \u2018flagrant violation of his suspension\u2019 by retrieving his daughter\u2019s food \u2014 a daughter and family member who had not been suspended or otherwise disciplined and who was only two years old and could not retrieve the food herself,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nThe intimidation tactics alleged in the complaint also include the club allowing Chene\u2019s wife to \u201cfollow Drury and his minor child around the Island taking video of him,\u201d violating the club\u2019s rules and policies; ignoring the plaintiffs\u2019 request to provide their tenant Marine Max access to the marina, which led Marine Max to break its lease; ignoring requests to designate one of the plaintiffs\u2019 club equity memberships to a tenant with a one-year lease; and refusing to timely answer questions that would allow them to rent their units out.\nBusiness dealings\nKennedy Lewis, Chene\u2019s firm, was one of the buyers interested in the TransMontaigne site, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that Chene used his board position to try to facilitate that deal and that Chene was also trying to lead a redevelopment of the beach club. Minutes from the meeting where this was discussed were \u201cnot initially posted as they were required to be,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nWhen club members learned about the proposed sale and redevelopment, \u201cthey became irate,\u201d according to the complaint. The board allegedly responded by warning members that they could be suspended if they expressed their concerns or disagreements.\nDrury and Kurkova\u2019s attorney, Altman, said the conduct outlined in the complaint is \u201cegregious\u201d and a \u201cpower grab.\u201d\nWith the\nResidences at Six Fisher\n, the single-family home project for which Elliman is currently leading sales, buyers receive membership to the club for free, Altman said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a $350,000 value, just the buy-in for the membership. They\u2019re getting substantial commissions from selling those units,\u201d she said. This, Altman said, \u201callows [the board] to wield control over who they allow into the club membership, because there\u2019s only 1,100 club memberships, period.\u201d\nIn its statement to\nTRD,\nthe club said it has the right to enforce its rules and standards of behavior.\nThe club has sought to shut down any disruption, and said it has been transparent about capital projects that it\u2019s embarking on. In an email sent to members in December obtained by\nTRD\n, the club said \u201cgroup text threads/chat rooms are serving to create disharmony across Fisher Island Club.\u201d The club strongly urged members to \u201ccease any attempts to undermine and disrupt the club\u2019s capital projects, and also to end aggressive attacks on club leadership,\u201d or risk being suspended for a period of 30 days.\n\u201cPlease: Sowing discord runs directly counter to our goal to be \u2018best in class,\u2019 the email states. \u201cIn the interest of both etiquette and harmony, we thank you for your adherence to all of our club policies, as we work to maintain and elevate the member experience.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Inter Miami champion Sergio Busquets closed on a waterfront home in Broward County on Friday, a day before winning the Leagues Cup,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nBusquets, considered one of the best defensive midfielders in the game, paid about $8.7 million for the seven-bedroom, six-and-a-half bathroom house at 7 Seneca Road in Sea Ranch Lakes, sources told\nTRD\n.\nThe village, a small town about 5 miles away from Inter Miami\u2019s Fort Lauderdale stadium, was rumored to be where\nLionel Messi was living\nafter he was spotted shopping at the Publix supermarket in Sea Ranch Lakes. Messi and Busquets are longtime teammates and friends.\nBusquets and his wife Elena Galera acquired the 7,100-square-foot home from Renovation7 LLC, a company led by Beth and David Geduld. Beth Geduld, who designed the home, confirmed the sale, but declined to comment on the buyer. She said the sale marks a record for Sea Ranch Lakes, a mostly waterfront and gated community.\nThe 0.3-acre property was on the market with Veroushka Volkert of Coldwell Banker for nearly $9 million. Volkert did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe house was just completed. It has about 100 feet of frontage on Lake Seneca and includes a three-car garage, according to the listing.\nBusquets played for FC Barcelona from 2008 until earlier this year, when he and Messi joined Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer team owned by brothers Jorge and Jose Mas, David Beckham and other investors. Inter Miami won the Leagues Cup final on Saturday night against Nashville SC in a penalty kick shootout to break a tie, according to\nUSA Today\n.\n\nInter Miami plays at Drive Pink stadium in Fort Lauderdale and trains next door at the Florida Blue Training Center. The team expects to eventually move to Miami, where its owners plan\nMiami Freedom Park\n, a massive mixed-use development that will include a soccer stadium on the city-owned Melreese Country Club property just east of Miami International Airport.\nMessi\u2019s arrival in Miami has created a huge buzz. Messi, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time, owns three units\nin Sunny Isles Beach\nbut does not appear to be living in them. He and his family have been house hunting in Broward and Palm Beach counties, brokers say.",

The 39-year-old, who retired from professional basketball during the offseason, raised the fund with longtime business partner Rudy Cline-Thomas.\nMosaic is focused on seed- and early-stage investments for companies in the enterprise software, fintech health care and sports company sectors. But one its first investments is in Vessel, a multifamily modular builder.\nOn its\nwebsite\n, Vessel champions its mission to provide \u201caccess to homes that are exciting, sustainable, and attainably priced.\u201d The startup is led by Neil Rubler, who has spent decades in the multifamily development business.\nModular construction is gaining steam as an affordable construction option compared to traditional homebuilding. In prefabricated construction, different parts of a home or property are built in a factory, then shipped to a site and pieced together. It\u2019s a tricky investment, though: modular home startup Veev Group\nraised $400 million\nlast year, only to\nlay off a third of its staff\nmonths later as it pivoted from high-rise apartments to smaller homes.\n\nIguodala and Cline-Thomas have been interested in the tech sector for some time, playing the stock market starting in 2010. When Iguodala joined the Golden State Warriors in 2013, however, the Bay Area\u2019s tech scene became readily accessible.\nThe former NBA Finals MVP started taking stakes in companies such as Zoom and Cloudflare, as well as taking meetings with venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz. Previous investments\nalso include\nNextdoor and Apartment List.\nIguodala was also one of several NBA players to invest in a\n$1 billion Boston real estate project\nbeing developed by Tishman Speyer.\nIguodala spent 20 years in the NBA, playing for four different teams, including separate stints with the Warriors. In addition to his championships, he was an All-Star once and won several defensive accolades during his career.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

And Palm Beach mansions are front and center to the game.\nThe National Football League starts its 2023 season Thursday night when the Detroit Lions face reigning Super Bowl champs, the Kansas City Chiefs. Fans everywhere have been holding their breath awaiting the return of Football Sundays (and Mondays and Thursdays), and all the drama that comes with them.\nLike the players and coaches, owners of the league\u2019s 32 teams have had a busy off-season. Magnates and moguls who run the league, most of them billionaires,\nousted\nlongtime Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder in July, and forced his sale of the team to an investor group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris.\nHarris was identified as a potential buyer at the annual NFL team owners meeting in Palm Beach in March, according to published reports. While Palm Beach is a picturesque site for a billionaire roundtable, it is also convenient. Many of the team owners have homes on the island among their sprawling real estate portfolios.\nBefore his firm\u2019s purchase of the Commanders, an entity linked to Harris flipped an oceanfront estate in Palm Beach for\n$66 million\nin December, up 86 percent from its last sale 18 months earlier.\nOther NFL sellers on the island include former Commanders owner Dwight Schar, who sold his South Ocean Boulevard estate for\n$45 million\nin January.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers co-owners Joel and Darcie Kassewitz also sold their waterfront mansion to spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners for\n$53 million\nin February of last year.\nMiami Dolphins owner\nSteve Ross\n, CEO of Related Companies, is among the most notable Palm Beachers in the league. He bought the mansion at 702 North County Road, also known as \u201cthe Reef,\u201d for $31.9 million in 2007, according to published reports. The billionaire is also West Palm Beach\u2019s biggest office building owner and is on a path to remake\nthe West Palm Beach skyline\n.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick roundup of other NFL owners and their Palm Beach real estate scores:\nRobert Kraft | New England Patriots\nRobert Kraft, billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, broke a Palm Beach real estate record in December, when he bought a penthouse at 110 Sunset Avenue for\n$23.8 million\n. The sale set a price record for condos on the island. He and his wife Dana Kraft\u2019s unit spans 5,000 square feet, with four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms.\nDavid Tepper | Carolina Panthers\nAppaloosa Management founder David Tepper, the league\u2019s wealthiest owner with a net worth of $18.5 billion according to Forbes, bought an oceanfront mansion for\n$68.4 million\nin 2021. The 1.1-acre estate at 905 North Ocean Boulevard includes a 12,000-square-foot mansion built in 2020. It has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool, records show.\nJeffrey Lurie | Philadelphia Eagles\nPhilly owner Jeffrey Lurie dropped\n$28.5 million\non a 13,200-square-foot waterfront mansion in 2013. The nearly 2-acre estate at 1275 South Ocean Boulevard has a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom house built in 2008, as well as a pool and dock, records show.\nOther NFL team owners with Palm Beach ties include the Rooney family, longtime owners of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones\u2019 Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams\u2019 new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million \u2014 roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

The former NBA champion and business mogul purchased the nearly 1-acre property via an Illinois LLC he controls.\nDr. Michael A.

In March,\nPatrick Park\n, an heir to the Park Corporation fortune and a longtime friend of Donald Trump, sold his estate at 136 Bears Club Drive for $19.8 million.

Property records show an entity led by Haitian American fashion designer Kerby Jean-Raymond sold the house for $6.8 million.\nThe Belle Meade property sold at a loss. The Jean-Raymond-led LLC paid $7.5 million for the house in April 2022.\nHochstein\n, who goes by Lenny, has been going through a highly publicized divorce from Lisa Hochstein, who recently moved from their Star Island mansion to a\nluxury condo\nshe is renting in South Beach. The divorce was a prominent storyline in the last season of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami.\u201d Although the divorce is not yet final, he is now engaged to model Katharina Mazepa.\nHochstein paid $2 million for the home at 42\nStar Island\nDrive in 2012. The couple tore down the previous house to build the three-story, 18,000-square-foot mansion that exists today.\n\nHochstein said he is working on plans to build a \u201cbeautiful home\u201d on the property as an investment. He said he is happy with his Star Island mansion.\n\u201cI\u2019m always looking at opportunities to buy something special and I think this property is special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime I can get almost 120 feet of water frontage on a wide bay \u2014 there are not too many places like that.\u201d\n\nThe Belle Meade property features 116 feet of open bay water frontage, according to the listing. It was on the market with Compass agents Ben Moss and Michelle Northern. Moss declined to comment.\nThe single-story house was built in 1956 on a 0.4-acre lot and has a pool and dock, according to the listing, which offers it as a possible redevelopment property.\nHome prices in Belle Meade have increased dramatically in recent years. This month, Tom Cruz, a real estate investor-influencer who made his wealth in Section 8 housing, spent\n$17.8 million\nfor the nearby waterfront mansion at 1125 Belle Meade Island Drive, setting a neighborhood record.",

But even his cabinet tenure may prove to be lengthier than the amount of time his Washington, D.C. townhouse will spend on the market.\nTillerson listed his townhouse in the capital\u2019s ritzy Kalorama neighborhood for $6.5 million, according to\nRobb Report\n. The listing came nearly seven years after the former Exxon chief executive officer\nsnatched up the property\nat 1832 24th Street Northwest for $5.5 million.\nWhile Tillerson and his wife have owned the townhouse for seven years, it barely took seven days for the couple to receive an acceptable offer on the pad. The home went under contract 11 days after being put up for sale, according to its\nlisting\n.\nThe purchase price \u2014 if the Tillersons get what they want \u2014 would break down to roughly $1,140 per square foot.\nThe 1920s townhouse has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and three powder rooms across 5,700 square feet and four floors.\nThe ground floor includes a laundry room, an office and a lounge that opens out to a courtyard-style garden in the rear. The home also has a terrace with a built-in barbecue and detached two-car garage.\n\nCompass\u2019 Mark McFadden and Hunter McFadden share the listing.

After being sworn in as Secretary of State on Feb. 1, 2017, the relationship between the two business titans quickly collapsed, including an incident reported by NBC in which Tillerson called his boss a \u201cmoron.\u201d\nTillerson was axed in March 2018, and claimed at the time he learned of his dismissal from a tweet posted by Trump.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Witkoff Group\u2019s plan to sell parking spots at its 150 Charles has landed the developer in a dispute with condo owners.\nThe developer started offering spots for $500,000 a pop in what Alex Witkoff told the\nNew York Post\nwas a solution to the West Village\u2019s \u201chuge parking problem that will only get worse with time.\u201d\n\u201cWith many West Village locations lacking garages and many neighborhood buildings converting garages to condos, 150 Charles St offers savvy buyers a rare opportunity to own a parking spot in prime West Village,\u201d Witkoff said in a statement on the sale, which is being handled by Serhant.\nThe developer said the tight inventory has made for \u201cunprecedented\u201d interest from 150 Charles residents and local residents. But some at the\ncelebrity-studded building\ntook issue with the developer\u2019s plan, which in addition to the hefty purchase price, includes a $500 a month maintenance fee with an annual escalation, according to an amendment to the condo\u2019s offering plan.\nA group of owners pushed back with an offer to buy 25 to 30 of the spaces for $10 million, or roughly $330,000 to $400,000 per spot, according to a memo obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. The memo raised concerns about the operation of the garage, citing security issues and expenses \u201call of which have the potential to impact the value of not just the parking easements, but our homes at 150 Charles.\u201d\nThe memo also called for a limit to the fee raises, pushed for the title to the garage to be transferred to the condo board after 90 percent of the spaces had been sold, and asked that 90 percent of the spaces be held exclusively for condo owners.\nA source familiar with the matter denied the developer received an offer, but an email about the memo indicated it was shared with the Witkoff Group.\n\nThe valet-attended garage, completed in 2015, includes 92 spaces up for sale, which were previously available to owners and the public for rent. The garage closed to renters at the end of May, according to an email obtained by\nTRD.\nA spokesperson for the developer said the spots were \u201calready significantly sold,\u201d but declined to share the specific number.\nWitkoff filed the amendment spelling out the parking details back in 2021, but 150 Charles residents raised concerns about the proposal earlier this year as the rental expiration approached, according to emails.\nThe developer\u2019s $500,000 asking price is steep for a parking space, but as the Post noted, not unheard of in Manhattan where\nmonthly parking costs\nhave ranked as the most expensive in the country. Another downtown building at 42 Crosby Street once marketed 10 spots for $1 million each.\n\nWitkoff launched sales at the 91-unit project in 2013, eight years after buying the former warehouse for $85 million. The building sold out in just three months with a buyer roster chock full of A-list names and corporate bigwigs, including singer Jon Bon Jovi, model Irina Shayk and Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 co-founder Peter Morton.\nThe 15-story building also made headlines last year when one of its penthouses sold for\n$52 million\n, or $11,500 per square foot. The seller, an entity linked to former Credit Suisse executive Robert Shafir, bought the apartment for $29 million in 2016.",

Miami is one of 16 cities that will host the FIFA World Cup games in 2026, with up to a half-dozen games planned at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\u201cWe\u2019re mainly now focusing on soccer because it\u2019s such a big thing for Latin America,\u201d Campos said. \u201cOne buyer has gone to the last seven World Cups.\u201d\nCall it Messi fever, as new condo projects are targeting marketing to soccer and Messi enthusiasts.\nThe developer of Oasis, a 500-unit condo development under construction at 1000 East Hallandale Beach Boulevard, is aiming for Messi fanatics. The project\u2019s developer, a group led by Giuseppe Iadisernia, references Messi in a recent advertorial in a Mexican magazine called \u201cHigh &amp; Beyond.\u201d\nMessi, a World Cup champion, joined the Major League Soccer team Inter Miami in July, and this month\nclosed on a waterfront mansion\nin Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Bay Colony.\nTo say his arrival in South Florida has\ncreated a frenzy\nwould be an understatement. So how does that translate into sales?\nDevelopers and brokers say Messi is part of the appeal for some buyers, especially as sales teams increasingly target buyers from Mexico and Latin America. Many are reporting growing interest from\nColombia\n, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador and Chile. Miami has long been referred to as the capital of South America, but that died down a bit during the pandemic.\nCamilo Miguel Jr., CEO of Mast Capital said his company is not doing any soccer-related marketing, but his projects are indirectly benefiting from Messi\u2019s move to South Florida, the World Cup and other events like Formula One. Mast\u2019s projects include the planned Cipriani Residences in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n\u201cMessi coming here is certainly adding fuel to an already hot fire,\u201d Miguel said.\nGraco Funes, a mortgage lender who splits his time between Chicago and Miami, said Oasis Hallandale\u2019s location attracted him. He\u2019s in contract to buy a unit at the project in part because it\u2019s close to both Hard Rock and about half an hour from Drive Pink. Funes is an Inter Miami season ticket holder and F1 enthusiast.\n\u201cA bunch of new friends of mine signed on to buy at the project simply because of the Messi factor,\u201d he said.\nThe gift that keeps on giving\n\nMost projects aren\u2019t running ads with Messi\u2019s face on them, but the f\u00fatbol superstar is part of the conversation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a part of the dialogue. We have two [developments] that will be done in time for the World Cup, and one of the things we were saying is they will be ready in time,\u201d said Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, referring to the Gale in downtown Miami and\n72 Park\nin Miami Beach. The latter is planned in North Beach, which is home to a large Argentinian community. (Messi is from Rosario, Argentina, northwest of Buenos Aires.)\nShe said Messi is \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving.\u201d\n\u201cEvery time Messi plays, Miami is seen internationally, all over the place,\u201d Cervera Lamadrid, managing partner of Cervera Real Estate, added.\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to quantify Messi\u2019s effect on new condo development, Edgardo Defortuna, CEO of Fortune International Group, pointed to the fact that Inter Miami\u2019s Instagram account has grown from about 1 million followers before Messi joined the team to now more than 15 million. The exposure is major.\nOn a smaller scale, Defortuna\u2019s firm is targeting soccer players as buyers.\n\u201cPeople like to be among their peers,\u201d he said. \u201cThose players bring with them some economic power.\u201d\nCase in point: Days after Messi\u2019s longtime teammate\nSergio Busquets paid $8.7 million\nfor a waterfront home in Sea Ranch Lakes, Messi closed on his purchase of the waterfront estate nearby.\nKevin Venger, who is part of the group developing the Major Food Group-branded Villa Miami condo tower planned in Edgewater, said that the sales team is talking to athletes who play professional soccer, football and basketball.\nVenger was also part of the group that developed One Thousand Museum in downtown Miami, where Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham owns a unit; and Regalia in Sunny Isles Beach, where Messi\u2019s family purchased a condo last year.\nMessi has had his eye on Miami for years. He purchased three oceanfront condos in 2019, including a unit at Dezer Development\u2019s\nPorsche Design Tower\n. But it wasn\u2019t clear then that he would play professionally in Miami. This year, he turned down a deal worth close to half a billion dollars annually from Saudi Arabia. His deal with Inter Miami, a team led by Miami businessmen and brothers Jorge and Jos\u00e9 Mas, is worth much less on paper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just soccer. Just the fact that these people who can live anywhere in the world chose to live here is an endorsement to the quality of life,\u201d Cervera Lamadrid said. \u201c[Messi] didn\u2019t move here to play soccer. He moved here\nand\nis playing soccer.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Mauricio Umansky is juggling plenty these days.\nThe co-founder and CEO of The Agency has his hands full opening offices at a rate of roughly 30 a year. That\u2019s flanked by a number of other projects that have placed the brokerage\u2019s and Umanksy\u2019s brands in many other verticals, including fine art, EdTech and some of the industry\u2019s weightiest topics.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to grow what I call a boutique business,\u201d Umansky said from his office in the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills headquarters. \u201cEvery other company is counting heads. Even when I get questions from reporters, it\u2019s, \u2018How\u2019s your recruiting going? How many heads and how many people and how many agents?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Who cares?\u2019 That\u2019s not my KPI. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m measuring.\u201d\nEfficient market share growth is what he wants, he said. Umansky used the example of 10 agents selling $2 million in business. If he can get them to $5 million, he just grew by $30 million without expanding headcount.\nAll that said, The Agency is undoubtedly in expansion mode by the numbers, opening office doors at a rapid clip, funded with its own capital. In fact, the company has only obtained outside capital once in its 13-year history, in 2022 when it announced a $35 million raise alongside its opening of an East Coast headquarters and the acquisition of tech-based brokerage Triplemint. The privately held company did not disclose how much it paid for the business.\n\u201cThirty [offices annually] is just the number that we feel that we can support and give a great experience to all of the agents,\u201d said Umansky, who is also founder of the American Real Estate Association trade group.\nThe office growth rate pencils out to two-and-a-half doors per month, which he said gives him about two weeks to provide personal attention to each new office and its agents.\nThe Agency now counts over 130 offices in 12 countries, with some of the most recent openings in Orlando, Fla.; Marblehead, Mass.; and Saskatoon in Saskatchewan, Canada.\nDiversification\nFueling the business\u2019 expansion into other services plays into The Agency\u2019s business culture since its founding in 2011.\n\u201cThe Agency is really more of an advisor than an agent,\u201d Umansky said. \u201cWe like to call ourselves real estate advisors and give really high-end experiences to our customers.\u201d\nThe most recent of those experiences would be The Agency Art House, which launched this week. The brokerage partnered with art collector and advisor Arushi Kapoor on the new endeavor, which advises clients on fine art purchases and sales.\nIn September Umansky rolled out his namesake EdTech platform aimed at real estate coaching and mentorship. The Mauricio Umansky Network charges $20 a month for those billed annually, or $30 for those paying monthly.\n\nThere are also a suite of core services The Agency touts partnerships with other firms including mortgage lending, moving and private wealth management.\nUmansky said he\u2019s never been one to hold his tongue. That\u2019s largely what pushed him in everything from starting up a coaching platform to being outspoken on industry issues, including NAR\u2019s Clear Cooperation Policy. He\u2019s of the opinion it strips sellers\u2019 of their freedom to choose how their properties are marketed.\n\u201cI\u2019m opinionated and since people are willing to listen, I\u2019m going to state my opinion and I\u2019m going to try and give back and improve an industry that gave me so much, gave me money, gave me so much love,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the need to help improve it and take it into the next era.\u201d\nBack to the balance sheet, diversification of revenue streams helps at a time when overall home-selling has been down. The past two and a half years have been pressured in comparison to the highs seen during the homebuying frenzy of the pandemic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been shitty for two and a half years,\u201d Umansky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a very difficult downturn and survival has been paramount. I think any company, any real estate brokerage that is telling you different is lying. Period.\u201d\nOverlooking \u201canomalies\u201d\nThe market reset adds to what Umansky called \u201cother forces\u201d that haven\u2019t necessarily helped the business.\nAt the national level, those include commission settlements paid out by many larger brokerages in relation to the Sitzer-Burnett class action lawsuit in Missouri federal court. The litigation against the National Association of Realtors raised concerns about agent commissions and transparency, spurring new rules that went into effect in August.\nIn Los Angeles, Umansky pointed to factors such as Measure ULA.\nThe transfer tax, which went into effect in April 2023, applies to residential and commercial property sales, levying a 4 percent tax on sales starting at $5.15 million and a 5.5 percent tax on those $10.3 million or more.\nAlthough there are still some clients that seek loopholes to bypass ULA \u2014 Umansky\u2019s heard of no one successfully doing so to date \u2014 he said many have adjusted to the tax.\nAs the end of 2024 nears, the CEO is upbeat on the new year and the release of more inventory.\n\u201cI do think 2025 is going to be a much stronger year,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be more reminiscent of something like 2019. I think that we as real estate agents have to forget the years of 2020 and 2021. Those were anomalies.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A hidden buyer with ties to Chicago picked up a waterfront Miami mansion next to billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin\u2019s estate. The Coconut Grove property once belonged to the Queen of Pop, Madonna.\nProperty records show wealth manager Paul Morelli, trustee of Brickell Holdings Trust, sold the 8,400-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion at 3029 Brickell Avenue to a company that is managed by the same Chicago-based professional services firm. Morelli, a managing partner at San Francisco-based Vernal Point Advisors, is also listed on the buyer\u2019s LLC.\nThe 1.2-acre property traded for $20.3 million, marking a loss compared to its previous $29 million sale price in late 2021. Madonna owned the estate from 1992 to 2000. It was built in 1928 and includes a dock and 100 feet of water frontage.\nThe same hidden buyer owns the house immediately northeast of the property. The entity\npaid $48.5 million\nfor the 1.5-acre parcel at 3007 Brickell Avenue in March, records show. Together, the adjacent properties total 2.7 acres. The owner could combine and redevelop the homes into a larger estate.\n\nDeveloper David Martin and his wife, Christina, own the house next door to 3007 Brickell Avenue. It is under construction.\nGriffin\u2019s property, at 3115 Brickell Avenue, is on the opposite side of the mansion that just sold. Griffin paid\nnearly $107 million\nfor Adrienne Arsht\u2019s former 4-acre waterfront Miami estate a year ago. Months after purchasing the property, Griffin proposed moving one of the homes, which is historic,\nsparking criticism\nfrom preservationists. The Citadel founder and CEO recently\nmoved Citadel\nand Citadel Securities\u2019 headquarters to Miami from Chicago.\nSources say Griffin is not the buyer of the other adjacent homes. A spokesperson for Griffin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCitadel plans a waterfront tower nearby at 1201\nBrickell\nBay Drive, which will serve as the company\u2019s headquarters.\n",

The 9,500-square-foot condo at 165 Charles Street, reported to be her daughter\u2019s New York City home, sold in July for\n$31 million\n, down from its initial $53 million asking price in 2019.\nThe Stewarts\u2019 new home is at the top of the 12-story building developed by Westbrook Partners, which took over the project in 2021 from HFZ Capital. The firm is now embroiled in an onslaught of litigation, with\nformer executive Nir Meir\nfacing criminal charges alleging he orchestrated an $86 million fraud scheme.\nWhen sales launched in 2017, the Belnord\u2019s offering plan set the asking price for the Stewarts\u2019 pad at $18 million. It later dropped to $13 million, as the developer lowered other prices at the building to contend with a slowing condo market in the years ahead of the pandemic.\nThe apartment has six bedrooms, living room with a fireplace, formal dining room and views of the building\u2019s landscaped courtyard.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Richard Ziegelasch represented the Stewarts in the deal. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Maya Kadouri had the listing.\nExterior images of the Belnord are known as the fictional co-op called the Arconia in Hulu\u2019s \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d\nThe 1900s rental building-turned-condo has a projected sellout of $1.3 billion, but sales progress is slow because the developer is renovating and offloading units as they become available. So far, the developer has sold about half of the units with prices ranging from $870,000 to nearly $14 million, according to Marketproof.\nMartha Stewart sold her company \u2014 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which published her magazine known as Martha Stewart Living \u2014 to Sequential Brands in 2015 for around $353 million. Her latest ventures include marijuana-derivative-infused candles and a cover photoshoot for Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue last year.\n\u2014 Sheridan Wall\n",

The weekly update from Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes Team tallies L.A. County homes under contract that are listed in the MLS for $4 million or more.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Janelle Friedman and Graham J. Larson have the listing for Carrey\u2019s Brentwood home.\n\u201cI want someone else to enjoy it like I have,\u201d Carrey told the Wall Street Journal last year.\nThe \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d and \u201cBruce Almighty\u201d actor\u2019s five-bed, nine-bath home is nearly 11,000 square feet. The property sits on a 2-acre lot and has six fireplaces, an Art Deco theater, tennis court, waterfall pool and guest house.\nBuilt in 1951, the home first hit the market last February with a $28.9 million ask before seeing a series of price reductions. It was most recently re-listed in September.\n\nA dozen homes went into contract last week, according to Eklund Gomes\u2019 weekly roundup. Those contracts equated to asking dollar volume of nearly $108 million. That compares to the prior week\u2019s nine contracts totaling $52.4 million in asking dollar volume.\nEklund Gomes\u2019 Marcy Roth forecast residential activity will likely stay flat through the holidays, \u201cunless we see another couple of big-ticket contracts come through.\u201d\nWhile single-family residential tends to dominate the weekly roundup, last week saw two condos go into contract.\nThe largest is a unit at the Rosewood Residences Beverly Hills at 9900 South Santa Monica Boulevard. It\u2019s listed for $15 million by Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman.\nThe unit, which came on the market in October, totals nearly 4,300 square feet with three beds, four baths, floor-to-ceiling windows and a service elevator. That\u2019s in addition to a 1,522-square-foot terrace that has a 25-foot pool, barbecue and lounge area.\nRosewood Residences, which counts 17 units, was developed and completed this year by Nahla Capital and GPI Companies.\n",

        "content": "NFL star running back Christian McCaffrey is holding onto his Super Bowl dreams with the 49ers, but he is parting ways with the last of his North Carolina real estate holdings.\nMcCaffrey, who played for the Carolina Panthers before his trade to San Francisco in 2022, has listed his French ch\u00e2teau-inspired estate on Lake Norman for $12.5 million,\nthe Wall Street Journal reported\n. The price for the roughly $11,000-square-foot house is $1,125 per square foot.\nVictoria Speer of The Agency Charlotte has the listing.\nSituated on about 9 acres, the gated property boasts about 500 feet of lake frontage and includes two gyms.\nThe decision to sell wasn\u2019t easy for McCaffrey, who said loves the house, but he had to let it go in light of his move to the Bay Area.\nMcCaffrey, engaged to former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo, had already vacated the Lake Norman home, and he\u2019s looking to profit on the sale.\nThe 27-year-old football player, drafted by the Panthers in 2017, bought the estate in 2020 for $7.5 million, setting a sales record for the Charlotte metro area at that time.\nThe property is composed of a 12,000-square-foot main home with six bedrooms, along with a one-bedroom guest house connected by a porte-cochere.\nOriginally intended as an offseason retreat, it became McCaffrey\u2019s full-time residence due to his fondness for the surroundings, particularly the backyard overlooking the lake.\n\nAdditional features of the estate include a wood-paneled study, stone wine cellar, sauna, elevator, and a barroom opening to the pool area. The primary suite features a two-story closet and a screened-in terrace.\nThe foyer has a 60-foot turreted ceiling. The great room has a double-sided fireplace, and the kitchen is equipped with a custom-made range from La Cornue. The property also includes a hidden panic room with a vault door.\nMcCaffrey converted a three-car garage under the guesthouse into a second, larger gym for his training needs during the season.\nThe estate has a movie theater, saltwater pool, spa, fire pit, grill area, and a second-floor outdoor kitchen. The grounds lead to a dock on the lake housing McCaffrey\u2019s boat, which will be included in the sale along with a Wildcat four-wheeler, a jet ski and a golf cart\n\nReflecting on his time at the property, McCaffrey shared memories of movie nights, family gatherings and water activities.\nWith McCaffrey\u2019s recent success on the field, scoring two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers, he now has the opportunity to compete in the NFC Championship Game against the Detroit Lions, with the potential for his first Super Bowl title if San Francisco emerges victorious.\nThe listing follows the $3 million sale of his Charlotte condo last year.\n\u2014Ted Glanzer",

They sold a waterfront\nAdmirals Cove\nspec mansion in May for\n$17.8 million\n, after buying the land for $9.9 million in 2021. Records show they also own an Admirals Cove condo they bought for $750,000 in 2021.\nAiello bought the 7,100-square-foot Tequesta estate for $11 million in April, records show. Built in 1991 on 2.1 acres, it was renovated and expanded in 2011, a previous listing shows. The compound includes a six-bedroom main house, a two-bedroom guest house and a total of 10 bathrooms and one half-bathroom. The estate also has a pool, library, tennis court, private beach and dock, according to the listing.\nWith the latest sale, Aiello\u2019s flip equates to $1.5 million, or nearly 14 percent in price growth in nine months.\nFor Kuchar, the waterfront compound is a second Palm Beach County home. Records show she also owns a condo in the gated golf community the\nBear\u2019s Club\n, which she bought last year for $6 million.\nNorthern Palm Beach County\u2019s luxury real estate market is a magnet for pro golfers and their families.

Neff is often credited with defining California-style architecture, with his work drawing influences from Spain and the Mediterranean.\nThe home has since been linked with other celebrity residents, including Quincy Jones and Marvin Gaye. Property records show the most recent seller acquired the property from Stephanie Booth Murray, the great-great granddaughter of Times Mirror Company founder Harrison Gray Otis.\n\nThe 5,500-square-foot home has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It includes a gated driveway, iron staircase anchoring the home\u2019s formal entry, chef\u2019s kitchen with a marble island, pool and writer\u2019s cottage.\nGarland\u2019s former home is the latest residential deal in the popular Bel Air market.\nThe trade comes on the heels of serial entrepreneur Jonathan Gray\u2019s $23 million purchase last month of 657 Perugia Way from Palmer Murray, who is the chair of financial services firm LourdMurray.\nIn May, Erewhon owners Anthony and Josephine Antoci bought 755 Sarbonne Road from VistaJet founder and chair Thomas Flohr.

The $9.5 million sale took place towards the end of June, but the identity of the buyer had been kept under wraps and remains unconfirmed by the athlete himself.\nThe quarterback arguably scored a deal for the home at 349 Crestmont Road, straddling the line with Cedar Grove; the new build was put on the market for $11 million in May, according to a\nproperty history on Zillow\n. The contract was signed within three weeks of that listing.\nJoan Barrett of Stanton Realtors held the\nlisting\n. The brokerage did not respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nExact square footage for the property was not publicly available, but the\nNew York Post\npinned the main home at greater than 4,000 square feet. The property as a whole spans more than two acres and was purchased through a limited liability company, the publication added.\n\nThe mansion includes eight bedrooms and ten bathrooms. There are panoramic views of the New York City skyline and a bevy of luxury features. The main bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and walk-in dressing room. There\u2019s also a gourmet kitchen, home office, media room, gym, wine cellar and three-car carriage.\nMaybe most importantly, the home is only a 20-minute drive from MetLife Stadium, where the Jets play their home games.\nThe four-time NFL MVP and one-time Super Bowl champion owns a $28 million property in Malibu, California, as well as homes in Chico, California, Texas and Tennessee. He also still owns a three-and-a-half acre property in Wisconsin, though he has yet to list the home close to the franchise where he\u2019s played his entire career to this point, the Green Bay Packers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It\u2019s like what Palo Alto or Menlo Park used to be like,\u201d Gregg Winovich, a fourth-generation rancher, told the outlet. \u201cThey can go places without getting molested.\u201d\nIndeed, Morgan Hill\u2019s allure for professional athletes extends beyond its picturesque hills and pastoral landscape.\n\nThe town offers a balance of privacy and accessibility, with San Jose just a short drive away. For athletes like Trey Lance, who celebrated the purchase of his Morgan Hill mansion in 2022, the town\u2019s real estate market offers affordability and agility.\n\u201cThese guys are transient,\u201d local real estate agent Chuck Vargas, told the outlet. \u201cEspecially the newer guys. They go to another team. Trey had to move quickly and his house sold in three or four days. He can get up and move.\u201d\nThe town\u2019s downtown area, revitalized over the past decade, buzzes with activity, offering a mix of dining, entertainment, and lifestyle amenities.\nBig-time\nfootball and real estate\nintersect frequently.\nLast week,\nUniversity of Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian\nand his wife, Loreal, put their Austin mansion on the market, asking $5.8 million.\nThe home at 3300 Park Hills Drive has six bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms on just under half an acre.

I\u2019m finished.\u201d\nNow, the Fox News host is buying himself a little more space and a waterfront view in Manalapan. Records show the 1840 South Ocean Boulevard Trust bought the mansion at 1840 South Ocean Boulevard from an LLC named for the address. The buying entity\u2019s trustees are Hannity\u2019s longtime attorneys, Christopher Reeves and Jay Sekulow, and William G. Lako, Jr., managing director of Henssler Financial. The Wall Street Journal first reported Hannity\u2019s involvement in the deal.\nHannity launched a longform interview program, \u201cSean\u201d on Fox Nation on Tuesday, beginning with an episode featuring Sylvester Stallone and wife Jennifer Flavin Stallone, who live in nearby Palm Beach at the lakefront mansion they bought for\n$35.4 million\nin 2020.\nVince Spadea of Douglas Elliman represented the conservative media star, and fellow Elliman agents Gary Pohrer and Nick Malinosky had the listing.\nThe identity of the seller was hidden. Local attorney Maura Ziska signed on behalf of the LLC.\n\nThe property last sold for $18 million in 2021, records show. The 12,000-square-foot mansion was built on 1.9 acres in 1990, and has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, one half-bathroom, the listing and records show. The estate spans from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway, with 150 feet of waterfront on either side. It is split by State Road A1A, with the main house, a pool and a dock on the Intracoastal side of the compound, and a one-bedroom beach house on the ocean side.\nThe seller renovated the estate, records show. It was listed for $29 million in February, according to Realtor.com.\nThis is not Hannity\u2019s first South Florida real estate purchase. The political commentator bought an oceanfront townhouse in Palm Beach for\n$5.3 million\nin 2021, and\nwon approval\nfor an addition to the unit in 2022. It is not currently on the market.\nPalm Beach County, home to Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, is a hub for conservative media and political players. Fellow\nFox News host Bret Baier\nbought a non-waterfront Palm Beach house for $37 million last year, and sold his starter home on the island for\n$13.5 million\nin January.\nFox News founder Roger Ailes\nbought a $36 million Palm Beach house in 2016, the year before his death. The late\nconservative radio host Rush Limbaugh\nassembled a sprawling 2.7-acre oceanfront compound in Palm Beach, which beauty heir William Lauder bought for $155 million last year.",

The floor also includes a wet bar, a private sun deck with a heated infinity pool and an outdoor hot tub.\n\nZeckendorf Development\nbuilt the 18-story, 16-unit building, which was designed by Robert A.M. Stern. Amenities include a resident manager, doorman, two roof terraces, a club room, a spa and a fitness center.\nIn marketing the penthouse, Srugo said the reopening of the\nGramercy Park Hotel\ncould lead to significant appreciation, \u201cbringing the property back to its original valuation.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

Copperfield made headlines in 2015 when his\nrooftop pool burst\nand flooded his penthouse and other apartments on the floors below.\nCopperfield moved out of the apartment in 2018 and terminated the staff previously charged with its upkeep, according to the complaint. After his departure, the board alleges Copperfield failed to maintain the mechanical equipment exclusively servicing his apartments, resulting in an incident with a drain valve that sent a \u201ccascade of water\u201d into other apartments, elevator shafts and hallways.\nThe board estimates the damage to total around $2.5 million.\nAn architect hired to evaluate the property earlier this year found the unrepaired water damage is threatening the building\u2019s concrete structure, as well as the health and safety of residents in neighboring apartments, the board claimed in the suit.\n\nThe board alleges they sent the report to Copperfield, but he only made \u201cband-aid repairs\u201d to the unit and did not address more serious concerns.\n\u201cIn typical fashion, Copperfield refuses to confront the consequences of his actions and denies all responsibility for the damage he has caused to the building and his former neighbors,\u201d the complaint reads.\nThe lawsuit states that Copperfield is looking to offload the unit, though the property isn\u2019t currently listed.\n\u201cThis is a simple insurance claim. The photographs included in the lawsuit don\u2019t reflect the current state of the apartment.\u201d said a representative for Copperfield \u201cThis is a court matter and will be handled in court.\u201d\nIn 2016,\nCurbed described\nCopperfield\u2019s home as the \u201ccity\u2019s most unique penthouse\u201d consisting of a \u201cspaceship-like assemblage of glass levels on top of a Midtown condo building.\u201d\nAt the time, the 16,000-square-foot apartment, originally built for General Motors heir Stewart Mott, was filled with antique arcade games, water guns and paintings of dogs dressed as humans.\nEarlier this year, the magician landed back in the news cycle when more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct spanning from the 1980s to 2014, according to\nan investigation by the Guardian\n. More than half of the women said they were teenagers at the time of the alleged incidents. Copperfield denied any wrongdoing.\nCopperfield broke Las Vegas price records in 2016 when he paid\n$17.6 million\nfor a 31,000-square-foot mansion in the city\u2019s high-end Summerlin neighborhood.\n\nThis article has been updated with a statement from a representative for Copperfield.",

Drawings also show the primary and guest suites include their own terraces.\nBrady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion who spent most of his NFL career with the New England Patriots, bought the 2-acre lot at 26 Indian Creek Island Road almost three years ago with B\u00fcndchen. They acquired the property through an LLC tied to Jeff Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Development. (Soffer and Brady are good friends, and\nSoffer lives next door\nat 27 Indian Creek Island Road.)\nThis year in June, the LLC secured a\n$35 million construction loan\nfor the home from JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFontainebleau Construction filed two notices of commencement, marking the beginning of construction, in 2021 for the lot. The filings call for a two-story home with a security building, gym, cabana, pool and sport court.\nIndian Creek has long been home to uber wealthy business people and celebrities, but a new group of them is moving in. In June, billionaire\nJeff Bezos\npaid $68 million for a teardown on the island. DJ and producer\nDavid Guetta\nis also in contract to buy the waterfront spec estate at 37 Indian Creek Island Drive that was asking $69 million.\nBrady\u2019s ex-wife, B\u00fcndchen, was recently spotted on the construction site that is her waterfront home nearby at 1400 Biscaya Drive in Surfside, according to paparazzi photos. She paid $11.5 million for the property almost a year ago when the former couple announced their divorce. B\u00fcndchen owns a non-waterfront home in Surfside that she acquired months before that.\nIn addition to the Surfside homes, she also\nrecently paid just over $9 million\nfor a 7.5-acre equestrian estate in Southwest Ranches, which is in western Broward county.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Jeff Bezos hit \u201cadd to cart\u201d and purchased a waterfront estate in Indian Creek Village for $79 million, next to a property he acquired this summer for $68 million.\nBezos bought the nearly 2-acre estate at 12 Indian Creek Island Road, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n. Bloomberg\nfirst reported\nthe news. The sale of the 19,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom mansion closed on Thursday, according to the Multiple Listing Service.\nDina Goldentayer and Danilo Tavares of Douglas Elliman represented the seller, Indian Creek #1 LLC, according to the listing and property records. The agents declined to comment. Goldentayer and Tavares also represented the buyer.\nThe sale gives Bezos, the second-richest person in the world with a net worth of more than $155 billion according to Forbes, 4.6 acres of contiguous waterfront land on the island.\nBezos acquired\n11 Indian Creek Island Drive\nin June\n. Both deals total $147 million.\nIndian Creek is a guard-gated island north of Miami Beach, where streets are private, allowing only residents and invited guests to enter. His neighbors include billionaire Carl Icahn, hedge funder Eddie Lampert, Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias.\n\nGoldentayer listed the mansion at 12 Indian Creek Island Road for $85 million in May. It includes a home theater, wine cellar, cabana, pool and 200 feet of bay frontage. The estate was built in 2000.\nRecords show Indian Creek #1 LLC paid $28 million for the property in 2014. Leo Kryss, a co-founder of the Brazilian electronics and toy company Tectoy, is named as a registered agent for the entity, according to a mortgage recorded in 2020.\nBezos and his fianc\u00e9e, former news anchor and pilot Lauren S\u00e1nchez, had been looking for a new or renovated mansion in the Miami area, sources previously told\nTRD\n. Bezos\u2019 ties to South Florida go back decades. He graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in 1982.\nLast year, his parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, purchased\ntwo waterfront homes\nin Coral Gables for $78 million.\nThough Bezos is the wealthiest person to purchase homes in Miami-Dade this year, he\u2019s not the only billionaire to do so. Billionaire hedge fund manager\nKen Griffin\nrecently picked up another estate on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island, giving him nearly 6.5 contiguous waterfront acres.\nEric Schmidt, a former chairman and CEO of Google,\npaid $63 million\nfor two adjacent houses on the Sunset Islands in Miami Beach last month. Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, have been collecting homes on the islands since at least 2020, spending more than $100 million over the past three years according to an analysis of property records and sources.\n",

The listing popped up on the market towards the end of July and comes with a complicated history, especially in recent years.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman has the\nlisting\n. She didn\u2019t comment on the listing to the publication.\nGiuliani purchased the 10th-floor apartment for $4.8 million in 2002. The unit had enormous entertainment potential and it has entertained everything from podcast recordings to federal law enforcement agents when It was raided in 2021 by the FBI during its probe into Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine.\nA year after the purchase, Giuliani married Judith Nelson on the lawn of Gracie Mansion. The mayor declined to sign a prenuptial agreement with his third wife, a decision that\nproved costly 16 years later\nwhen they divorced.\n\nJudith reportedly lived in the unit until May 2019. While Giuliani held on to the co-op after the divorce was done, Judith received the dream home in Water Mill, which she\npromptly sold\nin 2021 for $5 million.\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit includes a wood-burning fireplace, a semi-private elevator landing and it\u2019s located a stone\u2019s throw away from Central Park. Features of the building include a 24-hour doorman and a rule barring construction work during the summer.\nGiuliani\u2019s allyship with Donald Trump seems to have landed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d in hot water. The unit was put up for sale five days before the former president was indicted for his alleged role in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. While not explicitly named, it\u2019s widely believed that \u201cco-conspirator 1\u201d the indictment is none other than Giuliani himself.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Soccer superstar Lionel Messi scooped up a waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nMessi and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, acquired a 10,500-square-foot, eight-bedroom estate in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Bay Colony through a company led by Messi\u2019s wealth manager,\nAlfonso Nebot\n, records show and a source confirmed to\nTRD\n.\nMessi, who joined Inter Miami in July with great fanfare and has led the team to eight wins and four draws, has been spotted house hunting across South Florida, from Fort Lauderdale to Boca Raton. The longtime Barcelona player won the World Cup championship last year for his native Argentina. Messi is traveling to Bolivia this week to play in the second round of the\u00a0 2026 World Cup qualifiers.\nJohn and Stacy Dickerson sold the property at 91 Compass Lane to Messi and Roccuzzo for $10.8 million. The Dickersons paid $9 million for the estate in May of last year, which means they sold it for a 20 percent boost in price in 16 months.\nThe 0.4-acre property has 170 feet of water frontage with two docks, a waterfront pool, a gym/spa room and an Italian kitchen, according to a 2022 listing for the home. The house was built in 1988 and expanded in 2000, property records show.\n\nMessi and Roccuzzo\u2019s primary suite spans a massive 1,600 square feet.\nJennifer Abbott with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the seller in the off-market deal. Compass agents Samuel and Donna Simpkin represented Messi.\nMessi\u2019s home is about 5 miles from Drive Pink Stadium and Inter Miami\u2019s adjacent training facility in Fort Lauderdale. The team expects to eventually move to Miami, where its owners plan\nMiami Freedom Park\n, a massive mixed-use development that will include a soccer stadium on the city-owned Melreese Country Club property just east of Miami International Airport.\u00a0The team is owned by Miami businessmen and brothers Jorge and Jos\u00e9 Mas, as well as David Beckham and other partners.\nMessi\u2019s deal with Inter Miami is valued between $50 million and $60 million, plus equity in the team and revenue sharing agreements with Adidas, Apple and other companies.\nMessi\u2019s longtime teammate, Sergio Busquets, who joined Inter Miami alongside him, recently paid\nabout $8.7 million\nfor a waterfront home in\nSea Ranch Lakes\n,\nTRD\npreviously reported. It\u2019s not far from Messi\u2019s new mansion.\nMessi also owns three luxury condos\nin Sunny Isles Beach\n, including a unit at Porsche Design Tower, which was completed by Gil Dezer\u2019s Dezer Development in late 2016.\n",

Called the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report L.A., the weekly roundup tracks signed contracts of residential properties with prices of $4 million or more. All data is sourced from MLS.\nProperty records show Vivenda da Lua\u2019s seller is a family trust tied to the late interior designer Erika Brunson, for whom the estate was designed.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Joyce Rey has the listing for the property, which totals 9,183 square feet. Its design was modeled after a Spanish Portuguese villa.\nHighlights of the Bob Ray Offenhauser-designed property include a three-story main house, attached guest suite, pool, gardens, library and Zen room.\nThe home hit the market in November for just under $20 million before a series of price cuts.\nOverall, single-family homes in the county sat on the market for an average of 60 days, with prices averaging $6.9 million, according to the Eklund-Gomes report.\nThe House of the Moon sits less than two miles from another Bel-Air property, named Villa Del Amor at 10936 Chalon Road, which entered the market last week for $115 million. It\u2019s owned by financiers and\nSugarfina board directors\nPaul Kessler and Diana Derycz-Kessler.\n\nThe county\u2019s second-largest contract last week is a home once owned by Muhammad Ali. The Hancock Park property at 55 Fremont Place is under contract for $13 million.\nProperty records show a notice of default sent Feb. 7 on the 10,567-square-foot home. It went to auction in April.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Stefani Stolper and Kristen Lawson, along with Coldwell Banker\u2019s June Ahn, are the listing agents.\nThe Fremont Place home was previously listed in 2022 for about $17 million by Michael Lawson, former Los Angeles Urban League CEO, and Mattie McFadden-Lawson.\nAcross Los Angeles County, a total of 27 single-family home contracts in the $4 million-plus market segment were inked between June 3 and June 9 for $185.5 million in volume, according to the Eklund-Gomes report.\nElsewhere in the country, Miami-Dade County counted 25 home and condo contracts totaling $220.5 million for the same period ended June 9, according to Eklund-Gomes Weekly Luxury Report Miami. The brokerage\u2019s New York report counted 24 properties under contract totaling $193 million, according to a report for the same week from Olshan Realty.\nOlshan produces a weekly luxury market report for Manhattan, with Eklund producing a similar roundup for Miami, Austin and now Los Angeles.\n",

Murdoch was\nin contract\nto sell the triplex at 23 East 22nd Street in October with a final asking price of $28.5 million.\nSelling the penthouse has been a slog for Murdoch. Two years ago, he listed the 7,000-square-foot pad for $62 million. Several reductions followed, including the markdown in June to $28.5 million from $38.5 million. All of the recent listing prices \u2014 and the final purchase price \u2014 pale in comparison to the $43 million the nonegenarian spent to purchase the pad in 2014.\nThe final purchase price works out to $3,400 per square foot.\nMurdoch bought the five-bedroom apartment along with another three-bedroom unit, spending\u00a0 a combined $58 million on the two. He sold the smaller unit in October 2022 for $12.5 million.\n\nThe condo, which spans the top three floors of the building, features six bathrooms and a corner great room with double-height ceilings. There\u2019s also a 600-square-foot terrace and views of the Hudson and East rivers.\nThe building, developed by Related Companies and the defunct HFZ Capital, includes a doorman, concierge, fitness center and pool.\nCompass\u2019 Kyle Blackmon had the listing. He declined to comment to Crain\u2019s after the sale hit public records. The buyer\u2019s identity could not be discerned from records.\nMurdoch is no stranger to taking a hit on the real estate front these days. In September, a months-long pursuit by his REA Group to take over the United Kingdom\u2019s largest real estate portal was soundly\nrebuffed\n. REA is locked in a rivalry with Andy Florance\u2019s CoStar Group, which has seen barbs and legal filings shot over the bow.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick still needs confirmation before becoming Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, but that\u2019s not stopping him from shopping Washington, D.C.\u2019s real estate market.\nLutnick is in contract to purchase 2400 Foxhall Road NW from another prominent name, Fox News anchor Bret Baier, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The deal is expected to close this week.\nBaier and his wife Amy put the French Ch\u00e2teau-style house up for sale last year, asking $31.9 million. The most recent asking price is $29 million, which would break down to $1,785 per square foot. A sale at that price would break the 17-year-old record for a residential deal in the nation\u2019s capital, a $24 million transaction in Georgetown.\nThe Baiers paid only $5.4 million for the property in 2018, but spent the intervening years building a 16,000-square-foot home on the one-and-a-half acre property. They spent nearly $25 million on the project.\nFeatures of the home include a marble fountain, a temperature-controlled wine room, a game room, a putting green and an indoor sports court. The four-story home has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms.\n\nDaniel Heider of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the\nlisting\n.\nResidential brokers in D.C. have\nbeen preparing\nfor an influx of well-heeled government officials as Trump prepares to return to the presidency next month. While there\u2019s plenty of wheeling and dealing in the nation\u2019s capital every time an administration turns over, the Trump administration brings a new cohort of wealthy industry titans to town.\nLutnick owns a number of homes, including a penthouse on the Upper East Side and an estate in the Hamptons.\nThe Baiers, meanwhile, moved on to Palm Beach last year,\ndropping $37 million\non a non-waterfront house at 125 Wells Road in an off-market deal. Shortly after, they sold a\nsmaller home\non the island for $13.5 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The apartment spans 6,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nA shell company tied to Schmidt bought Unit PHW from Wall Street and cryptocurrency executive Michael Daffey for $24.6 million in 2021. The condo underwent a multi-year renovation before it\nhit the market\nin mid-December, according to a Streeteasy listing, which claims Schmidt never lived in the home.\nThe property also features wood-burning fireplaces, two terraces, an outdoor kitchen and hot tub. It sits atop the eight-story boutique building developed by Goldman Properties and completed in 2007. Its amenities include a doorman, gym and parking garage.\nCompass\u2019 Nick Gavin and Kimberly Pressman had the listing.\nSchmidt\u2019s penthouse was one of 29 Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more to land signed contracts in the first full week of February. The total was up from 22 deals inked in the\nprevious period\n.\n\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was the 49th floor at 111 West 57th Street, with an asking price of $24 million. The apartment, which spans 4,500 square feet, initially asked just under $30 million when it was marketed off floorplans in 2016.\nThe condo has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, 14-foot ceilings and views overlooking Central Park.\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team\ntook over sales\nat the 82-story building, rising above the former Steinway &amp; Sons piano store, last summer. Since sales launched in 2018, 37 of the tower\u2019s 60 units have traded, averaging roughly $4,200 per square foot. Its amenities include a fitness center, pool and private dining room.\nOf the 29 properties to enter contract, 23 were condos and six were co-ops.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $259 million, which works out to an average price of $8.9 million and a median of $6.3 million. The homes on average spent more than 750 days on the market and were discounted 5 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "Lionel Messi was looking for privacy, luxury and space in his hunt for a home in South Florida.\nThe soccer superstar found it in Bay Colony, a waterfront community in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his wife\npaid nearly $11 million\nfor a mansion at 91 Compass Lane. The neighborhood is one of the few in the area \u2014 if not the only \u2014 that\u2019s gated with private round-the-clock security, according to brokers.\n\u201cOther communities are gated, but they don\u2019t have the 24-hour security,\u201d said Karen Bellows, an agent with Florida Luxurious Properties who is listing a nearby home at 30 South Compass Drive for $8 million. \u201cSome of the other neighborhoods that have some of these high-end homes, they are trying to match the security [of Bay Colony].\u201d\nMessi\u2019s 10,500-square-foot mansion, with eight bedrooms and nine and a half bathrooms, includes a 1,600-square-foot primary suite. It sits on a point lot with two docks and a pool. The property\u2019s 170 feet of water frontage and deep water dockage mean Messi will likely be looking for a yacht to rent or purchase \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t have one already.\nHe\u2019s not the first celebrity to call the neighborhood home: The late fast food giants Dave Thomas and Ray Kroc both lived in Bay Colony. But Messi is definitely the biggest.\n\u201cBay Colony was always an understated neighborhood,\u201d said Keyes Company agent Lauren Dekok, who is listing a home in the nearby town of\nSea Ranch Lakes\n, where Messi\u2019s longtime teammate\nSergio Busquets\nrecently bought a home for $8.7 million.\nRobert Esposito, director of sales at RelatedISG Realty, said Messi\u2019s purchase will put the area \u201con the map.\u201d\nMessi\u2019s arrival in South Florida created a frenzy this summer, with paparazzi tailing him as he toured homes in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Photos of him grocery shopping went viral. Messi\u2019s deal with the Mas brothers\u2019 Inter Miami Major League Soccer team is valued between $50 million and $60 million. He also received equity in the team and inked revenue sharing agreements with Adidas, Apple and other companies.\n\nMessi, Esposito said, probably chose Fort Lauderdale so his family \u201ccould live a more normal, quiet life.\u201d Luxury homes in Broward County are generally less expensive than those in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, but home prices have been on the rise.\n\u201cI see [prices] going up further because there is even more demand for these private communities now,\u201d said Chad Carroll, a top broker at Compass who focuses on Fort Lauderdale. Carroll said the Bay Colony neighborhood competes with Sea Ranch Lakes.\nMessi and his family are also close to Drive Pink Stadium and Inter Miami\u2019s adjacent training facility in Fort Lauderdale, and the prestigious Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, where his children may be enrolled.\n\u201cObviously you\u2019re close to\nthe schools\nand the stadium, but it offers larger estates\u201d than Sea Ranch Lakes, Carroll added.\nBay Colony is home to about 100 lots, all of which are waterfront. In 2021, author and social media influencer Patrick Bet-David\nset a record\nin the neighborhood with his $20.4 million purchase of the mansion at 141 Bay Colony Drive.\n\nJust four single-family homes are on the market, ranging from $4 million to nearly $9 million. The other listings are lots and condos.\nHedy Tufo, an agent with Douglas Elliman, also emphasized Bay Colony\u2019s security. She is listing the home she shares with her husband at 40 North Compass Drive, which is the priciest property on the market in Bay Colony, at $9 million.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very, very tough about who comes in and out,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to gain access, you either have to speak to the homeowner or have to be on the permanent list. There is no getting in and out. There is no driving around the neighborhood.\u201d",
